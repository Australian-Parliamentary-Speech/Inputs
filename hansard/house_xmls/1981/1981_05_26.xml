       Mr Sinclair-Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. Quite obviously the noise that is presently coming from King's Hall will affect the proceedings of the Parliament. I wonder whether some action might be taken so that Parliament can meet in a proper way and without interruption.

         â€”The point of order raised by the Leader of the House is, of course, not a surprise to me because I heard the noise as I came into the chamber. I have been aware of the noise all morning and I have considered very seriously what action should be taken. I have come to the conclusion that to take any action which would result in any forcible removal would probably be exactly what the protestors would wish. I am not prepared to allow the protest to prevent the Parliament from continuing to sit. Therefore, I think it would be best for us all if we proceeded with the business of the House forthwith.

       Trans-Australia Airlines

       The Clerk-Petitions have been lodged for presentation as follows and copies will be referred to the appropriate Ministers:

       Trans-Australia Airlines
      </para>
      <para>

      <para>
       To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth:
      </para>
      <para>
       Many Australians depend almost exclusively upon Trans-Australia Airlines for the provision of essential air services.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Federal Liberal Party policy objective of selling Trans-Australia Airlines within 4 years is contrary to the national interest.
      </para>
      <para>
       Sale of Trans-Australia Airlines would inevitably result in:
      </para>
      <para>
       (i) the creation of a private monopoly of major airline services in Australia;
      </para>
      <para>
       (ii) higher domestic air fares.
      </para>
      <para>
       Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the House of Representatives will reject outright any proposal to sell Trans-Australia Airlines.

       Excise on Beer
      </title>
      <para>
       To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth:
      </para>
      <para>
       1. The hotel industry in Australia is long-established and a valuable part of the community of this nation, providing places where the people may partake of the three basic needs of life: a place to eat, a place to drink, a place to sleep.
      </para>
      <para>
       2. The hotel industry is accepted throughout the nation as occupying an important place in the social and economic activities of Australia.
      </para>
      <para>
       3. The hotel industry is almost entirely within the private sector and makes a large contribution to the government in taxes of various kinds.
      </para>
      <para>
       4. The hotel industry has a need to sustain an appropriate level of turnover and growth, to make profit, and to sustain and improve the level of employment.
      </para>
      <para>
       5. The hotel industry of Australia is gravely concerned at published reports that the Government intends to increase excise charges on beer in the forthcoming Budget.
      </para>
      <para>
       6. Sales of beer constitute the major source of income of most of the industry's 5811 hotels in Australia.
      </para>
      <para>
       7. The very steep rises in beer excise in 1975 and 1978 severely retarded the growth of the Australian hotel industry.
      </para>
      <para>
       8. Any further increases in excise on beer in the 1981 Budget would further retard the industry at a time when growth is essential to maintaining economic viability and the ability to serve the constantly growing needs of the community.
      </para>
      <para>
       9. Such is its significance as a community requirement, beer occupies a place on the Consumer Price Index, and any alteration to its cost to the community would have an inflationary effect.
      </para>
      <para>
       10. Any increase in excise would result in and force the hotel industry to pass on such increase to the consumer by way of higher prices for beer.
      </para>
      <para>
       11. Higher excise would be only the starting point for an upward spiral in beer prices because of the presence of other factors, such as State Licence Fee taxes, which are directly linked to excise rates.
      </para>
      <para>
       12. The hotel industry of Australia already is gravely handicapped by heavy excise and other tax imposts, its growth is at a standstill; and, inevitably must decline if beer excise is increased.
      </para>
      <para>
       Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that Honourable Members of the House of Representatives:
      </para>
      <para>
       1. Recognise the importance and place of the Australian Hotel industry in the social and economic life of the nation.
      </para>
      <para>
       2. Accept that the viability of the hotel industry is essential to the maintenance of employment opportunities and stability of the industry is essential to enable it to continue to provide for the hotel needs of the nation in this period of growing population and increasing tourism.
      </para>
      <para>
       And further, that Honourable Members of the House of Representatives resist and reject any move to increase excise on beer.

       Unemployment Benefit

       The immediate and unconditional withdrawal of any proposals to deny unemployment benefits to unemployed people under 18 years old.
      </para>
      <para>

       That future employment policies be devoted to job creation and the restoration of full employment rather than the evasion of this responsibility by hiding the unemployed in short term training and education schemes.

       Public acknowledgement of the fact that unemployment is the result of insufficient jobs and not the fault of any minority group, the education system or the unemployed themselves.

       Taxation: Child Care Expenses
      </title>
      <para>
       To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth:
      </para>
      <para>
       A substantial contribution to Australia's economy by the payment of taxation and to the quality of life of fellow Australians, is made by parents in the work-force who have pre-school children.
      </para>
      <para>

      <para>
       Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that tax-payers who incur child-care expenses in order to earn income should be able to have those expenses exempt from income taxation in the same way as other tax-payers can deduct business expenses from their assessable income.

      <para>
       To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled.
      </para>
      <para>
       The humble petition of the undersigned showeth that your petitioners are gravely concerned by the threats to women's health and lives posed by Toxic Shock Syndrome, and urge the following steps to be taken as a matter of urgency:
      </para>
      <para>
       (1) Tampons, sanitary napkins, vaginal deodorants and similar sanitary products to be re-classified under Therapeutic Agents (not under ''Cosmetics'' as at present), in order to bring them under the scrutiny of the Australian Drug Evaluation Committee. We believe manufacture must be under the strictest hygienic conditions.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) After re-classification, we urge an immediate government-funded inquiry into all aspects of manufacture and content of these products. This must lead to: (i) contents of product and instructions for correct usage to be shown on packaging; (ii) removal of synthetic fibres, chemicals or ingredients that are potentially or actually harmful to users.
      </para>
      <para>
       (3) Allocation of extra funding for ongoing research by the National Health and Medical Research Council into these products, results of this research to be made public to ensure all health workers and potential users are fully informed. This campaign of public education would necessitate multilingual distribution of the information where appropriate.
      </para>
      <para>
       Your petitioners, therefore, humbly request that Parliament take immediate and positive action to avert possible threats posed to women's health by implementation of the above measures.

      </para>
      <para>
       That there is an urgent need to ensure that the living standard of pensioners will not decline, as indeed, the present level of cash benefits in real terms requires upward adjustment beyond indexation related to the movement of the Consumer Price Index, by this and other means your petitioners urge that action be taken to:

       Rosemount Repatriation Hospital

      <para>
       To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The petition of undersigned Australian citizens showeth:
      </para>
      <para>
       Rosemount Repatriation Hospital has been of inestimable value to eligible repatriation beneficiaries for many years, and the closure or dispersal of the facilities available at the hospital would be a retrograde step.
      </para>
      <para>
       The proposed decision to close Rosemount Repatriation Hospital through active discouragement by departmental administrative officers of any further referrals by medical officers of patients for medically prescribed occupational therapy is objectionable.
      </para>
      <para>
       Closure of Rosemount Repatriation Hospital would severely disadvantage veterans in Brisbane's northern suburbs, as well as their relatives and friends who would be required to travel a great distance in order to visit hospitalised veterans at either of the two alternative repatriation hospitals.
      </para>
      <para>
       Closure of Rosemount Repatriation Hospital and transfer of patients to Greenslopes would greatly add to the administrative burden of that repatriation and general hospital.

       Tertiary Education Fees

       Privacy and Personal Information

      </para>
      <para>
       Paragraphs 107 and 108 of the Privacy and Personal Information discussion paper number 14, brought down by the Law Reform Commission in June 1980, undermines the family unit and the authority of parents, which is the Christian basis of our society, by proposing that ''between 12 and 16 years, a child should be entitled to object to disclosure of information to a parent.''

       It is your petitioners sincere belief that:
      </para>
      <para>
       (a) an adolescent between the ages of 12 and 16 is not at a mature enough stage of life to decide whether or not the disclosure of information to a parent will be in the best interests of the adolescent.
      </para>
      <para>

       Defence Service Home Loans

      </para>
      <para>
       That all members of the Women's Services 1939-45 War qualify as 'Australian Soldier' under the Defence Service Homes Act for loans because on voluntarily joining the Australian Forces they took the oath to resist His Majesty's enemies making themselves available for combat duty in War Zones, and according to Acts and Regulations of the period the Military women had enlisted for service anywhere, some Naval women to sail in any waters, with all servicewomen available for service in Papua New Guinea.
      </para>
      <para>
       As those members of the Royal Australian Navy, the Australian Imperial Force and the Royal Australian Air Force of 1939-45 War who were not sent to War Zones are granted loans, refusal to grant eligibility to all Ex-servicewomen of 1939-45 War is unjust and unfair.

       Your Petitioners therefore humbly pray that you amend the Defence Service Homes Act by repealing Sub-section 4 (2A) (b) (c) (d) of the Principal Act as amended by No. 137 of 1978, and grant eligibility to all members of the Women's Royal Australian Naval Service, the Australian Women's Army Service, the Women's Auxiliary Australian Air Force, the Australian Army Medical Women's Service, and the Voluntary Aid Detachment of 1939-45 War.

      <para>
       It is well known that State testing of vehicles, where it occurs, is considerably inferior to that which takes place in the Australian Capital Territory.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) Considerable capital has been expended to further improve the service at Phillip. This taxpayers money should not be wasted.
      </para>
      <para>
       (3) If vehicles are to be tested by private enterprise, the public will have to pay a fee.
      </para>
      <para>
       If given the option, they would rather pay this fee to a government agency in the knowledge that the findings of the test would be completely un-biased, whereas through private enterprise, this may not always be the case.
      </para>

         â€”The Secretary-General of the Commonwealth had some discussions with me last week and I understand that he also had discussions with the Leader of the Opposition which I hope were as constructive as the ones he had with me. Since 1973 at least it has been the practice of the host country for the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting to send an emissary to certain countries. It is not a question of delivering an invitation. It is a question of discussing the up-coming agenda, the important matters for discussion and matters that might be sensitive within the general practice of consensus which is so important to the Commonwealth. Therefore, it has become a practice to do this very thing so there can be the widest possible input into the agenda and into the framework of the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        I should add also that this meeting is the second largest heads of government meeting held in any organised and regular way in any forum. The meeting of non-aligned heads of government is, I think, a larger meeting with a larger number of heads of government attending. But in many ways the Commonwealth meeting has some capacities that I think go beyond those of similar meetings. People from different groups, continents and races-from North and South-attend the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting and give it the capacity that people from one particular world grouping, meeting alone, may well not have. Therefore, it gives the Commonwealth a value which I believe is a very real one. It is the responsibility of the host government-a responsibility which would come to it maybe once every 50 or 60 years-to make sure that the Commonwealth meeting is held in the best possible climate, with the agenda properly worked through and with the widest possible input from as many of the Commonwealth members as possible. That is why senior members of this Parliament-Ministers and private members-are undertaking a mission which I and the Government regard as an important one, and an important part of the process. It ought to be remembered that I will be in London at the end of July and I will then be having further discussions with the Secretary-General. The agenda for the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting will not be finalised at that point but it will start to take very real shape. The draft agenda probably will be sent out early in September. All of this is part of the preparation for a meeting which is relevant and important.
       </para>
       <para>
        If anyone had doubted the relevance of the Commonwealth to the problems of the world in the 1980s and beyond, quite plainly the Lusaka meeting should have put those doubts very much to rest. It does the Commonwealth no service whatsoever for people to suggest that Australia is taking too much trouble with this particular meeting or is seeking to pay too much attention to it. It is an important meeting which can contribute seriously to current problems and especially to North-South economic problems. The more input there is to it by the 40-odd members of the Commonwealth in the preparatory stages, the better it will be. In relation to the Review of Commonwealth Functions, it ought to be noted that that review did not cut expenditure across the board. In a very large measure it is a rationalisation of Commonwealth functions and that rationalisation will enable the Government to do better the things that governments ought to do well. Holding this Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting is something that this Commonwealth Government will do well and it makes no apologies for it.

         â€”Yes, I have seen the statements made by the Minister for Local Government, Main Roads and Police in Queensland, Mr Hinze. I have also seen a copy of a letter that has been sent to a number of parliamentary members. I must say that I am at a loss to know what Mr Hinze is belly-aching about. The first truth of the matter is that, in accordance with the provisions of the legislation that is before the House, the Queensland road making authorities and also local government authorities will have the right to bid for any national road construction work that is put out to tender and contract by the State authorities. The other truth is that 90 per cent of road construction work in Queensland happens to be in the local government main roads area and 10 per cent of road construction work is in the national roads area. So, it is quite wrong for him to suggest that the implementation of the Government's policy will create chaos, unemployment and so on in Queensland.

        The real test of Mr Hinze's contention in this matter is whether Mr Hinze would bother to have a home built or any work done in his own area of business by day labour. I am certain that he would call for tenders from contractors to build his own home. I believe that he, as a roads Minister, has a responsibility to ensure that the public funds that are being expended on roads are expended to the best possible advantage of the public. He is dealing with taxpayers' funds-public funds. It is necessary to ensure that we get the greatest length of road possible from the funds which have been made available to carry out those works.

         â€”My question is directed to the Acting Minister for Primary Industry. When presenting the ministerial statement on the Review of Commonwealth Functions, the Prime Minister stated that the interest subsidy of the Australian Wheat Board 'is to be reduced by one percentage point'. The Minister for Primary Industry has since claimed that the statement referred only to a one per cent increase in the rate charged by the Reserve Bank of Australia's Rural Credits Department. Did the Government instruct the bank to increase the rate? If so, when will the Government table the instructions, as required by section 11 of the Reserve Bank Act? If not-that is, if it was an autonomous Reserve Bank decision-why was it misrepresented as a razor gang decision? Why did the Prime Minister refer only to the Australian Wheat Board when several other statutory bodies, including the Australian Dairy Corporation, will be affected by the Rural Credits Department's interest rates? Finally, why did the Prime Minister use the future tense-he said 'is to be'-when the Rural Credits Department rate was raised by one per cent a month before he spoke and by 0.5 per cent a fortnight after he spoke?

         â€”It has been a long-standing practice, because of the significant policy implications, particularly to Australian primary industry, of variations in the interest rate charged on Rural Credits Department advances, for there to be very close consultation between the Government, normally through the Treasurer of the day, and the Reserve Bank of Australia regarding the level of interest although, as the honourable member has correctly implied, the final decision on the level of Rural Credits Department advances is a matter for the Reserve Bank to determine. There has been no section 11 notice, letter or whatever one likes to call it written; nor indeed is that in contemplation. I have written a letter to the Governor of the Reserve Bank informing him formally of the decision that was the subject of the Prime Minister's announcement.

       <para>
        Over the past few months there have been changes in the rate of interest charged on Rural Credits Department advances. There was one in March and there was one, I think, on 15 May. Also there have been some fluctuations in the market rate of interest charged on borrowings by the Australian Wheat Board to the extent that it is borrowing on the commercial market. The intent of the Review of Commonwealth Functions committee's decision and the intent of the Prime Minister's announcement was to indicate a view on the part of the Government that the differential ought to be less by reason of a further rise. The question of any additional increase which would at some time be needed to give full effect to the intent of the Government's decision-a further increase of one per cent-is something that the Reserve Bank itself must determine, taking into account a variety of factors, some of which have been canvassed in the honourable gentleman's question.

         â€”My attention has been drawn to the statement. I am grateful to the honourable member for Bendigo for drawing to the attention of the House the scurrilous statements made by people who obviously flirt with the truth. Let me state the facts. Each year since 1945, the Commonwealth Government has made available to the States certain sums of money to assist them with welfare housing. The total sum of money made available over the 35 years of the agreement has been in excess of $5,000m. The Commonwealth Government, particularly in recent years, has been very generous with its advances on highly concessional interest rate terms and also by giving a significant part of its contribution through grants. The net result has been that in each year-if we take 1980-81 as an example-the States have been able to repay to the Commonwealth the interest and redemption on the year's loan in addition to meeting all their own administrative expenses and the cost of upkeep and maintenance on the dwellings. Yet they still have-I stress this fact-a credit of $142m. That is a significant sum of money that has been made available by the Commonwealth Government through its generous advances and its grants system.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        Under the agreement the States are required each year to pay back to the Commonwealth one fifty-third of the annual advances. When we look at that we note that each year the agreement is in existence obviously there is a requirement to pay back more funds. But there is no basis in logic or in justice to compare the repayments of interest and redemption by a State for a total lending period of 35 years with the annual contribution of the Commonwealth Government. If those honourable members who sit opposite advance that claim quite obviously what they are suggesting in fact and in essence is that if one gets a loan from someone with a firm commitment to repay it, one does not have to repay it. I repeat that through the generosity of the Commonwealth Government much has been done to assist in the area of welfare housing. It is blatant idiocy or untruthfulness in the extreme even to infer that this year the States will be repaying more than they are receiving from the Commonwealth.
       </para>
       <para>
        Finally, the Government has given a firm commitment of $1,000m to the States, coupled with the surpluses that they receive each year-I instance this year the sum of $142m. I hope that in some States-I name New South Wales-that would act as a catalyst for them to do something about overcoming the problems of welfare housing.

        In regard to the last part of the honourable gentleman's question, I am not sure to which other works he referred. The Bill refers specifically to national road construction works, not to maintenance works. The Government firmly believes that by adopting the tender and contract principle, in the longer term we will see much better progress in respect of our national roads program than we have seen in the past. I might add in passing that this is not a new principle. Quite a lot of work done by the various departments of main roads is, in fact, let out to tender. What we insist upon, since all national roads are eligible for 100 per cent Commonwealth government funding, is that the money we allocate to this purpose obtains the maximum length of road possible. We believe that the tender and contract system will ensure that. If the local governing bodies and the departments of main roads are efficient enough, there is no doubt that they will have every chance of winning in their bids. One needs to remember that local government, and, indeed, the departments of main roads, have an advantage that private contractors do not have-that is, they do not pay sales tax on the equipment that they purchase.

Firstly, does the Prime Minister agree with this assessment by his Minister of the Government's failure to deal adequately with the problem of youth unemployment? Secondly, does he regard this assessment as a serious indictment of policies which have had now more than five years to work and yet proved singularly unsuccessful? Finally, is it now the Government's intention to rectify this totally unacceptable situation and adopt the recent recommendation of the Schools Commission for the triennium 1982-1984 that 'an assessment of the existing pattern of youth training and support programs be undertaken with the view of developing a comprehensive youth policy'?

         â€”I thought that the honourable gentleman was referring to a Schools Commission report. I think it is worth drawing attention to the fact that that Schools Commission report emphasised the very serious matter that many Australian schools, if not all Australian secondary schools, were giving inadequate attention to large groups of young Australians. The Schools Commission made it plain that the schools were providing an adequate education for those with academic talents who might want to go on to a college or a university but that many other young Australians were going through school with a sense of failure and frustration, probably compounded by difficulty in getting work after leaving school. They had a sense of failure and frustration at school because courses and curricula related to that particular person's talents and inclinations were not available. Quite plainly that was a very serious indictment by the Schools Commission of many Australian secondary schools.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        As a result of that, the Minister for Education and the Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs have had extensive discussions with State governments about ways to improve the opportunities open to young Australians who are now lacking those opportunities. It is not just a question of jobs, it is also, for many young Australians, a question of adequate training. We earlier began the school-to-work transition training programs which are starting to make an impact. As my colleague has indicated, the Government is not satisfied with the progress that so far has been made. It has an open mind in relation to our training programs. If the honourable member for Wills or anyone else can come forward with positive proposals to improve the opportunities for training of young Australians or of other Australians in need of new or improved job skills, those suggestions will be examined in all seriousness. The honourable gentleman asked a serious question and deserves a serious and proper answer in relation to it. Our approach to the young unemployed has been one of evolution, the development of programs over a period aiming specifically, when we can, at the groups finding least satisfaction and least opportunity in the present system.
       </para>
       <para>
        To the extent that my colleague indicated in his remarks that we have an unsatisfactory situation-we are not satisfied with it because young Australians are unemployed and there are people at school who do not get adequate opportunities-obviously we want to improve it. I can only suggest that honourable members wait a little while until my colleague the Minister for Education makes a statement on education matters. That will show the shape of some of the initiatives that the Government believes should be carried out. The honourable member also suggested that the general programs to improve employment opportunities in Australia have not been successful. That, of course, is where I part company with him. I believe Australia has demonstrated very plainly that under Australia's policies private enterprise over the last two years has provided more jobs than it has provided for a very long while. If one compares Australia's economy with the United States, Germany, Britain and a number of other countries, one will find that Australia's economy is growing and employment opportunities are growing whereas in many places around the world those opportunities actually are shrinking. Over the last two years Australia's private enterprise has provided 250,000 additional jobs. That is much more than could ever have been provided by anyone's make-work schemes which, of course, would have been provided at vast additional cost.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government will be pressing forward with those economic policies which have been demonstrated to be successful and which a number of other countries are now starting to emulate. The Government also will press forward with seeking to provide more opportunities for young Australians who find themselves in difficulty either at school or after they leave school. As part of that examination, I remind the House that we also indicated that we want to examine the allowances available to low income families to make sure that people staying in full time training longer will not unduly affect the wellbeing of low income Australian families. The basis for action in that case, of course, is that over a long period the secondary allowance scheme will help low income parents put their children through the last two years of secondary schooling. That allowance was increased very significantly at the time of the last Budget. We are not necessarily satisfied that those arrangements for low income families are adequate. So the allowances available to people in full time education or training are also under review.

         â€”What I will say will all be relevant to that central point. I think I should draw the attention of the House to the fact that there are different kinds of sponsored trips. There are many trips sponsored by governments. There have been leader grants to the United States of America. There have been visits to Japan at the request and as a guest of the Japanese Government. Many honourable members have participated over the years in both of them. I do not think anyone would have any doubt that a trip which is openly sponsored by another government-I emphasise the words 'openly sponsored by another government'-so long as it is within the judgment of a member of parliament, could be accepted. It has happened both ways on a number of occasions. I think we then start to get into a category of sponsored trips which can have some doubt cast over them. It has been customary for members of all parties, over many years, to participate in Qantas Airways Ltd inaugural flights or the launching of a ship. They are commercial in their nature. I do not think anyone would want to cast any doubt in relation to them.

        I think this invitation was one that was cast in the public domain. Nobody was seeking to do it in any secret way. Quite plainly members' travel is a matter that members themselves must decide. I think that this instance and the publicity that has related to it have made it quite plain that the sooner this Parliament discusses in detail the Bowen report and applies it to the members of this Parliament the better it will be. That is under discussion at the moment with members of the Parliament. I draw attention to the fact that the Bowen report has been applied in relation to Ministers and the Commonwealth Public Service. Of course, commercially sponsored trips by Ministers would be outlawed under the Bowen report. But I emphasise again that members of parliament are in a somewhat different position. I believe that they need to make their own judgments about these matters for themselves against the background of experience in the Parliament generally and also against the background of their own common sense.

I am not sure of the exact state of their progress, and I will advise the honourable gentleman in due course when I have checked. I can assure him that there is a recognition of the difficulties of the people there, and I hope that an early resolution of the problem can be secured. Of course, once the satellite is available the problems of people who live on the west coast of Tasmania, and in many other isolated and remote areas of Australia, will be alleviated as a result of the ability to place an earth station and a transmitter on site to overcome the present transmission difficulties that occur in some areas of this country.

       <para>
        With respect to Access 80 and Dover, the position is slightly different. Many communities around Australia would like an extension of their present local call access. The whole concept of Access 80 was to provide an opportunity for everyone to have access to a main business centre. As I understand the position in Dover, many people would like access to another business centre, but that does not deny the fact that, within the definition provided by Telecom, access is already available to a business centre. In those circumstances there seems little prospect that the Access 80 extension suggested by the honourable gentleman's question is likely to be realised.

I am surprised, to say the least, that the University Council would have made the reported statements without first being fully aware of all the conditions and details of the Government decisions. Of course, the Government has announced its intention to reintroduce fees in a limited way. I refer, of course, to the decision to reintroduce fees for second and higher degrees. Within that area there are certain exemptions-for example, for recognised double degrees and also for holders of Commonwealth and university post-graduate awards. So far as the published comments from the University of Adelaide are concerned, I will have discussions in the near future with representatives of the Vice-Chancellors Committee. I hope that all universities will co-operate with the Commonwealth in this regard. Indeed, I believe that the proposed student loans scheme will prove to be of great benefit to a large number of students throughout Australia. I hope that the University of Adelaide would not take any action that would perhaps deny the benefit of this scheme to its students. So far as the honourable member's question concerned action that the Government might take if the University failed to co-operate, I am not prepared at this stage to comment on what actions we might take to ensure that students are not disadvantaged. I can give the honourable member and the House an assurance that the Government will pursue the implementation of this loans scheme as rapidly as possible so that it will be in place to operate from the beginning of 1982. Whatever decisions are taken will be decisions to ensure that no student is disadvantaged by the actions or views of a university.

I want to make it clear that in no way do I assert that there is any evidence that this is in fact the motive behind this invitation or that the people who have issued it are of such character as to seek quite immorally to influence the role of government.

       </para>
       <para>
        I am sure there is no need to go over the episodic nature of what I want to present to the House as it has developed so far. The point I was making is simply that there is a matter of very high principle involved in relation to the propriety of the conduct of members of parliament. It is hackneyed, I know, to repeat the old axiom that justice must not only be done but seen to be done. Similarly, just as hackneyed but no less important is it as principle to declare that not only should there be proper conduct by members of parliament but also it should be seen as proper conduct by members of parliament. We should take every reasonable and proper step to put as much distance between ourselves and any sets of circumstances which may appear to compromise-even if, in fact, they fail-our integrity and independence as members of parliament.
       </para>
       <para>
        For that reason the report 'Public Duty and Private Interest' was drawn up. I see many defects in it but it is better than nothing. It is stronger in its proposals than anything the Government is prepared to adopt. It is not our fault that this report has not been fully canvassed in this House. The Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) said that he wanted a full debate on it. We would welcome that opportunity. But I remind honourable members that it is more than 18 months since the report was brought into the House. I outlined in the wording of the motion, which I will not repeat, the concern felt by members of that committee-I might mention that they are quite conservative members-in relation to the potential for a member of parliament, or other people, such as office holders or Ministers, to be compromised by certain circumstances and that, therefore, a code of conduct ought to be followed.
       </para>
       <para>
        When introducing the report in the Parliament on 22 November 1979 the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Anthony) said, among other things:
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government has accepted virtually the whole of the Committee's recommendations in regard to Ministers, public servants and other officials.
       </para>
       <para>
        This would include us. In that statement 'virtually' means 'effectively' and 'totally'. Recommendation 8 (c) of the report declares that people such as members of parliament should not:
       </para>
       <para>
        . . . except as may be permitted under the rules applicable to his office, accept any gift, hospitality or concessional travel offered in connection with the discharge of the duties of his office.
       </para>
       <para>
        There is no other way to interpret the acceptance of such an invitation as I have mentioned-the conditions of which are familiar to honourable members-but as concessional travel which is associated with the discharge of the duties of office of those two members, Senator Collard and the honourable member for Bowman. They are both members of the Government's committee on communications. It has been said by the honourable member for Bowman, at least in newspaper reports, and no effort has been made by the Goverment to repudiate these statements, that the offer to him came through the Minister for Communications (Mr Sinclair). I refer to a report in yesterday's Australian Financial Review which states:
       </para>
       <para>
        His selection-
       </para>
       <para>
        That is, Mr Jull's selection-
       </para>
       <para>
        For the trip had come through Mr Sinclair's office, he said.
       </para>
       <para>
        Not only do members have to disengage from this quite undesirable practice but also the Minister is responsible for conduct which is highly questionable in these circumstances on the face of evidence which is publicly available. The Government should take the first opportunity available to repudiate these statements if they are not correct. At least the Minister should repudiate them. He will have the opportunity to do so directly. But the key point at which I am getting is that these sorts of invitations are inappropriate invitations for members of parliament to accept. It seems to me that there is a vast difference between an invitation at an official level offered regularly by a government such as the Japanese Government to members of this Parliament, which I understand is reciprocated by the Australian Government, where it is clear that the objectivity of members of parliament is not in any way sullied.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Opposition also received an invitation from Mr Rosenhain of Myer Emporium Ltd in the following terms:
       </para>
       <para>
        I am quite prepared that the same terms and conditions be offered to members of the Federal Labor Party to travel to the same convention for the same length of time, e.g. departing Australia 27 May, returning to Australia in time for Government sitting 9th June.
       </para>
       <para>
        I have arranged for a response to go today rejecting that invitation. Two wrongs will not make a right. Both the honourable member for Bowman and Senator Collard are quite wrong in their behaviour if they accept these invitations. Sufficient official trips are available to members of parliament. As well there is an overseas travel entitlement for each parliamentary term which would more than adequately meet the travel needs or travel lust of members of this Parliament without allowing themselves to be compromised in the way in which the honourable member for Bowman and Senator Collard seemed determined to be.
       </para>
       <para>
        I repeat, more leisurely, the communications between myself and the Prime Minister on a similar matter in 1978. On that occasion my colleague the honourable member for Newcastle (Mr Charles Jones), as a member of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Road Safety, contacted me about a letter received by the Chairman of the Committee, the honourable member for Kennedy (Mr Katter). I quote from this letter at some greater length. It stated:
       </para>
       <para>
        It seems to me that what the letter boils down to is a proposal that a Parliamentary Committee should be sponsored by, and thereby become a beneficiary of, the Japan Automobile Association Inc. in making a trip to Japan. If my information is correct, it might seem that action may have been initiated by a member of the Committee--
       </para>
       <para>
        The honourable member for Kennedy-
       </para>
       <para>
        to encourage this offer of sponsorship.
       </para>
       <para>
        That is a quite improper action in my view. The letter continues:

        Mr Jones is concerned about the propriety of a Parliamentary Committee being sponsored in this way by organisations which might well be seen by the public, whether rightly or wrongly is not important, as being self-interested parties in the subject matter being inquired into by that Committee.

        I share his concern and I know that those of my colleagues with whom I have discussed this matter share my concern. I should think that the principle is that if it is necessary for a Parliamentary Committee to travel overseas to further its investigations then the cost of any such travel ought to be exclusively supported by Parliament.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Prime Minister's response came on 20 February. I repeat it. The Prime Minister stated:
       </para>
       <para>
        I . . . expressed my view to Mr Katter that this invitation should not be accepted.
       </para>
       <para>
        There can be no quibbling about the directness and the firmness of the Prime Minister's expression of view to the honourable member for Kennedy nor can there be any gainsaying that it was influential, because the honourable member for Kennedy desisted from any further purpose in this respect. The trip was not undertaken. I suggest that if it had been, there would have been enormous compromising of the members of the Committee who were participating in that way. Exactly the same set of circumstances apply in this case. We are surely not in such a mendicant position that we have to go around cap in hand soliciting for trips overseas or holding our breaths trusting that some wealthy and self-interested-I say this without any reservation-sponsor comes forward to promote us on a trip overseas. That immediately compromises our impartiality in any matters before us related to the self-interest of those people.
       </para>
       <para>
        There is another aspect: Whilst I have the greatest respect for Mr Rosenhain of Myer Emporium Ltd, to the extent that I have been able to gauge his character on the few occasions I have met him, the fact is that he is a member of a consortium which has a vast interest in communications in an area which is directly a concern of the communications committee of the Government and, therefore, one which implicated very much the attention of the honourable member for Bowman and Senator Collard. Again, there is the aspect that the other members of the consortium are unknown to use. There is a very high degree of anonymity about that association. If we put all these scores together, there is the potential for people outside the Parliament who harbour reservations from time to time about just how independent members of Parliament might or might not be, to draw the most seedy and undesirable conclusions and then to broadbrush the lot of us as a result of those conclusions. The conclusions may not be justified but on the basis of superficial evidence there is a case to justify them and to draw the worst possible conclusions. At least, many of those people will believe this and so the suspicions will develop. I repeat: When it is all washed up, we all suffer to some extent as a result of that sort of thing happening. There is no need for any member of this Parliament to become a beggar or a mendicant, looking about for free overseas trips sponsored by self-interested parties, hoping that one will turn up or, if one does fall his way, to grab it with both hands and refuse to give it up.
       </para>
       <para>
        The recommendations in the report of the Bowen Committee of Inquiry concerning Public Duty and Private Interest make abundantly clear the proper standard of conduct in these matters. The standard of conduct which has been adopted in this instance by the honourable member for Bowman and Senator Collard is quite improper.
       </para>
       <para>
        Finally, the behaviour of the Minister for Communications in acting as a sort of channel, as it were-a post office-in passing on these invitations, if the reports are correct, to the benefactors of this largesse is quite improper too. I believe that there can be no quibbling by members of this House about how they vote on this motion. After some preamble, the motion requires that the honourable member for Bowman and Senator Collard should immediately withdraw from being sponsored to engage in this undertaking-this trip. If honourable members vote against that motion, they vote against consistently proper standards of conduct being applied in matters such as this-proper standards of conduct which applied in the case of the honourable member for Kennedy when on one occasion he was soliciting for a free trip overseas.

         â€”Mr Speaker, I second the motion and I will make my remarks now. I will be very brief because I understand that there are time contraints. Let me deal with the matter on the basis of what has already been elicited at Question Time. I would think that the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) is very much against any members of the Parliament, including the Senator mentioned and the honourable member for Bowman (Mr Jull), taking part in the trip that has been mentioned. I refer to the Bowen Committee of Inquiry concerning Public Duty and Private Interest which has been mentioned earlier today. The Committee's report clearly indicates that the terms of reference of that inquiry concerned what procedures should be followed to determine whether there has been any breach of the high standards which are properly required of those in public office.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        If we start by talking about the standards required of those in public office, those standards apply to every member in this Parliament. It just begs the question to argue about whether members of Parliament can accept offers made through a Minister or directly without being tainted by the fact that there were some pecuniary advancements for the member or members concerned. I refer to the Code of Conduct and the Committee's report which states:
       </para>
       <para>
        The impression should be avoided that any person can improperly influence an office holder . . .
       </para>
       <para>
        That would apply to a member of Parliament-
       </para>
       <para>
        or unduly enjoy his favour.
       </para>
       <para>
        I think it is very clear when we are talking about the Government at the present time that we have to be very stern about the fact that the Bowen Committee was set up way back in February 1978. It reported as far back as two years ago. Nothing has been done about that report by this Parliament. There has been no discussion or no implementation of the Code of Conduct. Is it any wonder that the honourable senator and the honourable member concerned might feel that they can avail themselves of a generous offer overseas because no rules have been laid down?

It is virtually a censure of the Government to find two years later that there has been no implementation or intelligent discussion of that report. If we had implemented the code of conduct recommended by the Bowen Committee, whether by statute or under Standing Orders, it would be very clear that no member of parliament could avail himself of offers such as those made to an honourable member in this House and a senator in the other place.

         â€”As the honourable member has pointed out, he could not accept any gift at all. There are rules and regulations governing the sorts of gifts that Ministers may accept. Gifts to Ministers create the impression that there is a way to buy favours. We cannot run a democracy if that is the case. We are talking about the implementation of cable television. Any of us who have had an interest in the communications field in the past, as many of us have, know that it is the most profitable aspect of television. It is highly centralised. Ownership is controlled. It will make enormous profits for a select group of people. In the time of the Labor Government enormous influences were brought to bear. People wanted cable television implemented in Australia because it would benefit certain proprietary interests, not the general public. There is great advantage in having cable television. It gives all sorts of benefits to those owning the cable and deciding what comes through it.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The honourable member and senator concerned in this matter will not find out anything new. If they want to know about cable television they will find that people involved in the telecommunications system in Australia have enough input into this area. They know what it means, how it is implemented, who owns it elsewhere in the world and why these multinationals want to bring it to Australia and own and control it. This is not in accordance with a number of principles which we hold on this side of the House. We should consider communications from the point of view of public ownership, public control and public benefit, not private ownership, exploitation and profit. If the two gentlemen concerned accept this offer, saying that they will give us information that we cannot get ourselves, they will leave themselves wide open to the belief that they are beholden to those who paid their way. It would be a stupid thing for them to do. It would determine whether they held their own seats and what public opinion of them would be.
       </para>
       <para>
        Not one of us in the Parliament can escape the fact that if we accept a trip from anybody, other than a trip provided by the Parliament, it will be deemed by public opinion that we owe something to those offering the trip. Of course we would. It is unbusinesslike of the Myer Emporium Ltd or anyone else to suggest that this is an intelligent thing to do. The Myer Emporium is interested mainly in domestic and retail sales. Communications come within the national network in respect of which a fair amount of public money has already been expended in setting up the base frame. It is important that nobody should intrude into this area by offering a fringe benefit in order to gain profits for shareholders or some select group. What we think should have been done has been made very clear by my leader.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Parliament went to a lot of trouble to set up the Bowen Committee. It set out its terms of reference in 1978. The Committee reported in 1979. Nothing has been done since. There is a responsibility on the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) and the whole Cabinet to implement quickly in the Parliament the codes of conduct recommended by the Bowen Committee, whether by statute or Standing Orders. This would remove the necessity to move a motion in this House urging two members of parliament, in their own interests and in the interests of the dignity and stature of the Parliament, not to accept an offer of private travel. Anybody in his right mind would know that such offers should not even be considered. The offer has been made and the members concerned are obviously interested in going. It makes it so much worse that we have to take the time of the Parliament to move a motion suggesting that they do not go. If they go their seats should be forfeited. They say that they will come back with clean hands and that they will have learnt something they could not have learnt in Australia. If they want to go, let them get some intelligent advice from the communications research group in Australia.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is dangerous for the private sector to offer trips to Ministers or back bench members of parliament so that they may take an interest and inform themselves. On many occasions local government throughout this country has been the subject of litigation on the basis of conspiracy, fraud or the suggestion of private commissions. It is considered that if something is offered to a person, perhaps he will be under an obligation to treat an application favourably. Mr Speaker, you will know that if anybody offers a person a trip, even in a taxi, to look at a property it is deemed to be an infringement of the Local Government Act in most areas. It is as serious as that, even at a lower level of government. It is beyond comprehension that trips overseas can be sponsored by the private commercial sector with a view to gaining a benefit for that sector.
       </para>
       <para>
        I urge the Prime Minister, when he next answers questions in the Parliament, to say that he will do something about the recommendations of the Bowen Committee. It is his task to do so. The Committee reported two years ago. It is important that we now implement the code of conduct it recommended. As my leader said, if we had implemented it there would be no question of these gentlemen undertaking such a trip.

         â€”The report of the Bowen Committee of Inquiry concerning Public Duty and Private Interest needs to be looked at, first of all, in relation to the motion that has been moved by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Hayden) and seconded by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Lionel Bowen). In particular, the two sections to which you, Mr Speaker, adverted in explaining the motion need to be examined. I think we also need to have an understanding of the recommendations of the Bowen Committee report that the Government has accepted and those parts of it yet to be considered. There is no doubt that with respect to those people we customarily know as office holders-Ministers and public servants-the recommendations of the Bowen Committee report have been adopted. Other sections of the report applying to the private members in this place at this stage have not been adopted. However, a code of conduct has been recommended. It is to that code that the motion moved by the Leader of the Opposition addressed itself. The Leader of the Opposition drew attention to section 8(c) in paragraph 4.9. It states:
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        8. An officeholder should not . . .
       </para>
       <para>
        (c) except as may be permitted under the rules applicable to his office, accept any gift, hospitality or concessional travel offered in connection with the discharge of the duties of his office.
       </para>
       <para>
        I think we all know that whatever the definition of public duty and private interest, people at all levels in this place accept some form of hospitality or concessional travel. Let me illustrate two areas. Very few members in this place have not been to some of the areas of developing resources in Australia. In those developing areas, particularly in the remoter parts of Australia, it is often not possible to travel by ordinary vehicle. It would be extraordinary if honourable members had not travelled by whatever farm or company vehicle was made available for the purpose. Similarly, very few members of parliament would not at some stage have accepted a meal from one or other of the people involved in many of the diverse activities associated with the business of Australia. There has to be a definition of the rules applicable to the office of a member of parliament. I see this as a necessary part of the determination that the Parliament will be required to undertake with respect to the recommendations of the Bowen Committee.
       </para>
       <para>
        At this stage, however, let me assert again that there has been no acceptance by the Parliament of any of those rules relating to private members. Therefore, it is for the private member himself to determine whether and to what degree he will accept concessional travel, hospitality and gifts. To the degree to which he accepts them, of course, it is, without any doubt, obligatory on him, if he feels that in any way they compromise him on matters that come up for consideration in this place, to declare his interest. Those laws do not relate to the Bowen Committee proposals. At this stage they have not been adopted. I received a letter on 1 May 1981 from Mr K. A. Rosenhain, the Corporate Managing Director of the Myer Emporium Ltd. It read:
       </para>
       <para>
        There are many people including some Members of Parliament, who have no appreciation of exactly what Cable Television is or can be. As far as I can see this condition will not change significantly unless some corrective action is taken.
       </para>
       <para>
        Given that the deliberations of the Broadcasting Tribunal will be news for the months before, during and after the hearings, it would seem that at least those Members of Parliament involved with communications should understand Cable Television.
       </para>
       <para>
        I interpolate that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Lionel Bowen) a few moments ago addressed himself to the fact that there would be no advantage in people finding out about cable television. Let me assure him that the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal at the moment is conducting a public hearing into cable television and subscription television in order that the community can be better informed on the matter and so that we can take decisions in this place on what steps are necessary for the advancement of those two communication developments in Australia. There is a necessity for members of this place to know something more about cable television and subscription television than, I suggest, many now do. The letter continues:

         â€”The point to which I seek to draw particular attention is that it is up to individual members to determine what assistance they accept towards meeting the expenses of a trip, whether they should go and the degree to which they find an invitation is in accordance with their own understanding of their obligations to their constituents and to this Parliament. In those circumstances I find it very hard to accept the motion that has been advanced by the Leader of the Opposition. He is suggesting that the Bowen Committee report, particularly with respect to the two sections that he read out, is in some way in conflict with accepting overseas travel. If we are to accept that as a proposition, it would mean that a distinction must be drawn between trips of this nature and other trips that have been referred to in this place such as are offered by airlines. A number of members from both sides of this Parliament and from both Houses have accepted invitations to travel on inaugural journeys.

        As the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) indicated in his response at Question Time, an examination certainly needs to be made of the provisions contained in the report of the Bowen Committee in order that we can set down rules which are to be applicable to a member's office. At this time no rules are applicable to a member's office. Therefore, the suggestion that any member of this place might accept an invitation cannot be in breach of the rules mentioned by the Leader of the Opposition in his motion. Indeed, it is my understanding that Mr Rosenhain sent a similar invitation to the Leader of the Opposition. Whether the members of the Opposition accept that invitation, of course, is a matter for them in exactly the same way as it was a matter for the honourable member for Bowman and Senator Collard.

         â€”The point is that, under the provisions of the Bowen Committee report, there is no obligation on any member of this place, other than Ministers who have already accepted the dictates of the Bowen Committee report. Until rules are prescribed for members other than those office-holders, it is not possible to say that the motion moved by the Leader of the Opposition is in fact correct. Therefore, I believe it is entirely a matter for an individual member to decide. It is a matter for the honourable member for Bowman and Senator Collard to determine to what degree they should accept an invitation and what hospitality they should accept in relation to it. In those circumstances, I do not believe it is appropriate for the Government to accept the motion moved by the Leader of the Opposition.

The first point I wish to make relates to a comment made by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Hayden). I think just about everybody in the House agreed with his opening comments when he referred to the need for this matter to be aired and discussed. Having said that, let me make it perfectly clear that both the honourable member for Bowman (Mr Jull) and Senator Collard are very well known to me. I am convinced that they could not give a damn in hell whether they go overseas. They simply saw an advantage perhaps to gain knowledge that would be valuable to the back bench committee to which they belong. They gave some thought to the matter. I make that matter clear.

Then came out that little mean streak that he cannot avoid, that little bit of meanness that seems to be hidden away in him. On this occasion, his meanness was aimed at me. I will accommodate him any time he likes. He said that the honourable member for Kennedy no doubt solicited an invitation to go to Japan. Let me tell the House that the honourable member for Kennedy, who has been here for 15 years, has not had a trip of any nature-with about three exceptions.

I should like to return to the subject with which I want to deal. I reiterate that I have had three trips. I made one trip to the United Nations which was an extremely important assignment, although perhaps honourable members opposite do not consider it such. Another trip was to Zimbabwe. If there is any doubt about how enjoyable that trip was honourable members opposite should ask the Opposition spokesman on health matters. He can tell the House what a wonderful five weeks that was. The third trip was back to Zimbabwe for two days with the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) in his aircraft for the celebrations, which were pretty good, let me tell the House. But I must correct myself. I did have another trip overseas, one when I was Minister. I got on a punt and I went out through the Heads to meet HMAS Melbourne to welcome back Vietnam troops. That was overseas; it was over the Harbour at any rate. I am speaking from a position of advantage, as a person who has not had a trip, with those exceptions.

It was suggested that we spend five days in Japan, going to five different plants and looking at five experimental safety vehicles with the object of saving 10 lives a day in this nation.

There are one or two new members of the Opposition who, whenever they are stuck for words-regrettably that is not very often-start throwing mud. They have been mud slingers from the word go.

        I wish to get back to the subject which we are debating. I have spoken for longer than I wished but I will conclude. The invitation was discussed by all members of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Road Safety. The honourable member for Newcastle decided that he would discuss the invitation with his troops. They were completely against accepting it. I then wrote to the Prime Minister. He wrote back to me and said that it was not wise to accept it and he did not think it was advisable at all for us to go to Japan. That was the end of it. The Leader of the Opposition said that I solicited an invitation. I could not even tell him whence it came. I deny that entirely. I think the Leader of the Opposition has a little streak of meanness in him which must come out from time to time. So long as he does not make me his target, I do not care how mean he gets.

         â€”Prior to my entering this Parliament, I had a career in radio and television which spanned some 13 1/2 years. During that time I covered a multitude of areas of experience, ranging from journalism to the management of a metropolitan television station. During the period I was employed by a television station, I undertook a number of study tours. In fact, I visited the British Broadcasting Corporation twice. I also visited Independent Television, the National Broadcasting Corporation, the Columbia Broadcasting System and the Tokyo Broadcasting System. It was of interest and of great value to me to be able to learn during those visits of the tremendous advances that were being made in the electronic media. In fact, I have a working knowledge of cable television.

        It is true that earlier this year Senator Collard and I were approached by a representative of the Myer organisation who suggested that it would be advantageous for us to go to the cable television conference which will be staged next weekend in Los Angeles and which will be attended by some 8,000 delegates from around the world. It is true that Senator Collard and I approached the Minister for Communications (Mr Sinclair) and discussed it with him. It is also true that we had some doubts as to whether this trip would be viewed as some sort of pay-off. An invitation was duly extended, as the Minister has rightly pointed out. Because of the incredible explosion that will occur in this country in terms of communications during the next decade, Senator Collard and I decided on balance that it would be of very great advantage-not necessarily to our committee, although it would be, and not necessarily to the Government, although I am sure it would be-to this Parliament if we were to attend.
       </para>
       <para>
        One has only to consider the standard of debate that goes on in this House every time a communications Bill comes into the place to realise that an appalling lack of knowledge exists in this area in this House. Indeed, some of the classic speeches have been made in the Senate by the Opposition's spokesman on communications, Senator Button. Indeed, it would be of great advantage if Senator Button in fact attended this conference because he certainly has very little knowledge of the way cable television operates at this stage. The idea of going on this journey was for us to learn about and to communicate what is happening with regard to the tremendous international telecommunications explosion which is now occurring. In fact, we looked at the possibility of examining the developments that are occurring with satellites. Australia, obviously, is entering a period in which it will launch its own satellite. We will then have a communications system which will be of great benefit to each and every Australian, especially Australians in outback areas. At no time did I ever feel that my position would be compromised. Certainly it would not be compromised to any greater extent than it was during the 13 1/2 years that I worked in radio and television. It was not compromised during my time in that job when the opportunity for overseas travel came up. Certainly, I would not think my position would be compromised any more than that of a number of journalists throughout this country who take inaugural flights on a very regular basis.

The balance of judgment should be, in fact, whether to take advantage of the opportunity of going to these places to learn about them and come back and discuss what we have seen and what we have learned. Some people might think that sometimes those governments will try to place some obligation on us. Indeed, some years ago I travelled to the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics with the honourable member for Griffith (Mr Humphreys). I think the honourable member and I have a very real appreciation of what happens when a foreign government does try to pour the acid on its official guests. I think we handled that particularly well. I do not think there was ever one ounce of doubt that we would accept that sort of compromise or be influenced by the nature of what was given to us as a fait accompli. No women were involved; I think I should clear that up. But it is a fact that all of us are placed in this position. We are treading on very thin ice.

        Last night I spoke for some time to the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser). I said to the Prime Minister at that time: 'Frankly, if this is going to be an embarrassment, I do not mind pulling out'. I cannot think of anything less exciting than sitting in an aeroplane for 17 hours and then going straight to a convention for four days. Whoever described this trip as a junket obviously knows very little about it. It would be obvious to the very meanest intelligence that when one goes on a trip such as this, one goes to work. We do not necessarily go to be under palm trees and be fed grapes and wine by some half-naked woman. That seems to be the implication of certain members of the Press Gallery. I do not think that sort of accusation, which is being conveyed to the public of Australia through the Press, should be levelled at members of the Parliament, whether they be members of the Government or members of the Opposition. Most of us who have been on a trip such as this realise that it is just a plain hard slog and plain hard work.

        The decision that I have made could make it very difficult for other members of the Parliament. I trust that the Leader of the Opposition in raising this motion knows exactly what he has done for each and every one of us this afternoon. There was an opportunity for us to go and to learn about cable television. Australia during the next 10 years will have the opportunity to develop one of the most magnificent communications system in the world. There was an opportunity for us to have an input into that line of policy. But, on balance, purely because I do not want to cause any particular embarrassment and because I do not want to cause any problems for any member of this House, I have decided to withdraw from that trip.

But, on balance, let us hope that this does not blow open the whole system of the educational process for parliamentarians because week after week we get nothing but lambasting from the Press on the ignorance of politicians, on the laziness of politicians and on the failure of our politicians. It would be nice if one day some member of the Press Gallery could do a constructive feature on exactly what is involved in being a member of this place. Indeed, if we do not have the opportunity to improve our education in the matters in which we deal I think it is going to be a very sorry day for this House, and most particularly for this Parliament. So on balance, I intend to advise the people who are providing the air ticket for this trip that I will not be going tomorrow night. I think the shame is that the Parliament will not have the value of the knowledge that will be gleaned from that world-wide conference which will be held this weekend.

         â€”I am prompted to join in the debate because of the remarks made by the honourable member for Bowman (Mr Jull). I do not want particularly to defend or criticise members of the Press. I do not necessarily want to defend everything that people on this side of the House say in relation to the media and so on. I just think that the honourable member misunderstood the point of our criticism and comments in this matter. It is not a question of whether the Australian Labor Party is for or against the development of cable television. Of course we are in favour of all these things which will be of help and benefit to the community in the future and, clearly, communications is one such thing. Cable television is clearly a vehicle for far better communication between people. The question at issue is: Who is going to own it, who is going to run it? That is where the doubt about the wisdom of the honourable member's trip comes in. It is not that the honourable member is going off on a junket to lie under palm trees, and God knows what else he envisages. In my opinion that is not what the Press thought when it criticised the honourable member. It was raising the fundamental question of the propriety of someone going at the expense of a firm or a consortium which has a vested interest in getting its hands on the control of this particular area.

        It was concerned about the propriety of the honourable member, as a member of the Government side of the Parliament-the side of Parliament which will determine policy-availing himself of this laudable opportunity to learn. If the conference is so important why could not the Government pay the honourable member's fare. The cost is only peanuts compared with all the money that the Government is spending on lots of other things. Why not at the same time send some honourable members from this side so that we can have a balanced and knowledgeable debate on this issue? The Press has criticised the honourable member for seemingly accepting an offer from a private consortium that has a very strong interest in gaining control of this area. How can the Government then claim to be taking part in the decision making process in a dispassionate fashion when clearly the honourable member, in a sense, is in the consortium's pocket from the point of view of the financial commitment that has been made to send him to the conference? That is the issue at stake.
       </para>
       <para>
        When the honourable member criticised the spokesman of the Labor Party in the Senate for his attitude on this matter he again misunderstood what our member was trying to say. The Labor spokesman and this Party are not arguing against the use of technology in the way the honourable member is implying. We are arguing against a device that would have the power to concentrate the control of information in the hands of so few people. We are arguing against this power being put in the hands of private consortia such as the group that is seeking to send the honourable member off on this trip. These are the reasons why the Leader of the Opposition has raised this matter. We laud the Press for raising the issue. We are glad to see that the honourable member has at least seen sense and decided to withdraw.

The honourable member referred to a document but he did not publicly identify that document. At the moment I do not quite know what he is referring to. I say quite categorically as Minister that there is no proposal to sell the merry-go-round or any of the other facilities referred to. There is no recommendation being brought forward by me or by my Department that the merry-go-round or any of the other facilities should be sold. I add for the record that we do not intend to put Lake Burley Griffin on the market for sale either.

      <para>
       I will get to the honourable member for O'Connor in a moment. He is living evidence of the extent to which the Liberal Party in Western Australia has fallen into the hands of crooks and gangsters. This is one of the reasons-
      </para>
      <para>
       When I rose to speak I asked whether the honourable member for Fraser (Mr Fry) had consulted the specialist character assassins of his own party. Apparently the honourable member for Fremantle seemed to identify with those words because by way of interjection he said:
      </para>
      <para>
       Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order. The honourable member for O'Connor--
      </para>
      <para>
       The Deputy Speaker called the House to order. The honourable member then said:
      </para>
      <para>
       Still owes the Shire of Carnarvon $180,000--
      </para>
      <para>
       The Deputy Speaker again called the House to order. The honourable member for Fremantle continued:
      </para>
      <para>
       That he has misappropriated.
      </para>
      <para>
       I say that this is incorrect. I thought it might be worth pointing out how tall stories from little acorns grow. On 16 May 1979 the Shire of Carnarvon decided by resolution to send its entitlement of two delegates to the annual conference of the Country Shire Councils Association of Western Australia. As I would be attending as the president and consequently the chairman of that conference, it was decided that my air fare totalling $176 should also be paid. Section 513 (1) (G) (I) of the Western Australian Local Government Act prescribes that a council may pay reasonable expenses necessarily incurred by not more than two delegates of the council and one other member appointed by the council as an observer. The auditor consequently decided that the council should not have paid my fare to act as president. I have been advised accordingly. Both the council and I opposed this decision and the council supports my refusal to pay as a matter of principle. I think the honourable member for Fremantle might realise the principle behind it. I could afford the cost of this travel. However, obviously it should not be a prerequisite to attaining the presidency of a body such as the Country Shire Councils Association that one should have the personal means to be able to finance one's attendance at such conferences.
      </para>
      <para>
       Finally, I point out that just last week, on Wednesday, 20 May, I was entertained in Carnarvon by the Shire of Carnarvon at its special invitation and in the company of some 60 guests. A presentation was made to me at that time, and five speakers rose to their feet-they included a prominent member of the Australian Labor Party branch in Carnarvon-all of who spoke in my honour. It appears the people of Carnarvon consequently know a little more about me than the honourable member for Fremantle.

They are the the reports of the Ninth Session of the Conference held in New York from 3 March to 4 April 1980 and of the Resumed Ninth Session which was held in Geneva from 28 July to 29 August 1980. With your leave, Mr Speaker, and the leave of the House, I would like to say a few words about the reports and about the Law of the Sea Conference itself.

         â€”Ever since the first substantive session of the Conference in Caracas in Venezuela in 1974, the Australian delegation has produced detailed reports of developments at the Conference. These reports contain an account of the negotiations and have annexed to them copies of the most significant statements that were made during that particular session as well as copies of the negotiating texts produced by the Conference. Since the Fourth Session of the Conference in 1976, the Delegation's reports have been published in bound volumes and have been tabled in this Parliament. The result is that we now have available to us a detailed history of the Law of the Sea Conference, as seen through the eyes of the Australian Delegation. As far as we can ascertain, no other delegation has prepared such comprehensive reports and few governments have tabled the reports of their delegation to the Law of the Sea Conference in their Parliaments. Honourable members may be interested to know that the reports are also widely read in sectors of the community interested in the Law of the Sea, especially in Australian universities and in fishing and conservationist bodies. They are also studied closely by State governments and by the mining industry, both of which have had representatives attached to the Australian Delegation at the last few sessions of the Conference. Furthermore, the reports are provided to a number of foreign governments. I understand that they are found to be of considerable use, particularly by our neighbours in the South Pacific region.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        In short, the reports of the Australian delegations to the Law of the Sea Conference represent what I believe is a successful attempt by successive Australian governments to make information, on a complex subject of great significance to Australia, comprehensible and accessible to the Australian community. I commend them to the attention of honourable members. The Law of the Sea Conference is perhaps the largest, certainly the longest running, diplomatic conference that has been convened since the founding of the United Nations. It is an ambitious attempt by the international community to try to bring order and certainty to an area covering seven-tenths of the earth's surface-an area where legal doubts and uncertainty currently exist. The draft Convention, which is now being considered by the Conference, has been painstakingly put together over the last six or so years. It contains over 350 articles on every aspect of the Law of the Sea. There are articles defining the limits of national jurisdiction over the territorial sea, exclusive economic zone and continental shelf; there are articles providing for freedom of passage through straits used for international navigation and through archipelagos; there are articles on the protection and preservation of the marine environment and on the conduct of marine scientific research; and of considerable significance for the future, the Draft Convention proposes a regime to govern the recovery of the mineral riches of the deep seabed beyond national jurisdiction, which the United Nations has agreed should be regarded as 'the common heritage of mankind'.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is self-evident and needs no emphasising by me that, as an island continent with extensive off-shore areas and a heavy dependence on international trade, Australia has a vital interest in the issues before the Law of the Sea Conference. It is an objective of the Australian Government that the International Law of the Sea be cleared of the doubts and uncertainties that exist today and that some new concepts around which a wide measure of agreement has grown up should be recognised. To this end, successive governments of Australia, both on this side of the House and on the other, have taken the view that our very substantial interest in the Law of the Sea would best be protected by the early adoption of a comprehensive and widely-accepted Convention. Australian delegations have worked hard to ensure that our interests are met in the texts that have been prepared by the Conference. I am pleased to report to honourable members that these efforts have largely been successful.

        Before the start of the Tenth Session of the Law of the Sea Conference, which was held in New York from 9 March to 24 April this year, there was reason to hope that it might be possible to conclude the negotiations on the outstanding issues, so that the way would be cleared for a Law of the Sea Convention to be opened for signature at a special meeting of the Conference in Caracas, perhaps later this year. As honourable members may be aware, however, the new United States Administration decided to review its policies towards the Law of the Sea Conference and indicated that it would not be able to participate in further substantive negotiations until that review was completed. Because the Conference is proceeding on the basis that the provisions of the new Law of the Sea Convention should, if possible, be adopted by consensus, one of the consequences of the American decision was that it was not possible to conclude the negotiations at the Tenth Session. As I indicated in response to a question in this House on 30 April, the Government has taken available opportunities to explain to the United States Government that, while we fully understand its need to review its policies on the Law of the Sea, we hope that the review will be completed quickly so that a Convention, in which Australia has vital interests, can be adopted as soon as possible. Indeed, I spoke in these terms to Secretary of State Haig during my visit to Washington in March.
       </para>
       <para>
        The next session of the Law of the Sea Conference will be held in Geneva in August this year. I understand that it is unlikely that the United States review will be completed by that date. The Government is hopeful, nevertheless, that it will prove possible to make more progress at that Session than at the last, so that the great advances that have been made in recent years in drawing up the Draft Convention can, as I said here on 30 April, be translated into a document which governments can ratify. I can assure honourable members that the Government will do its best to keep them fully informed of developments on a matter of such importance to Australia.

         -by leave-The statement by the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Street) is important. He referred to the long history of the Law of the Sea negotiations which have gone on for six years to eight years. Tremendous efforts have been made by over 150 countries to bring the negotiations to a successful conclusion. Yet, we find ourselves in this position, without any consultation, of the United States effectively stalling the completion of the Convention on the very eve of its success. We have to be very critical of this situation because the reason given was that the new Reagan Administration virtually wanted time to consider its position. In the process of so doing, the Administration also sacked all its negotiators. The point that ought to be emphasised is that these negotiations have been going on, as I said, for six years, seven years or eight years.

        Today I gave notice of a motion which I hope we will pass. It related to the Law of the Sea and to the fact that we will want this House to say that the Australian people want the Convention adopted. We would like this to be done when the Tenth Session resumes in Geneva in August 1981. We want to do that to convey to the United States the views of the Australian nation. I add that a motion in similar terms was passed unanimously by the Canadian Parliament. I think that we can say on this matter that we have a bipartisan issue and that we want to see it carried into effect on the basis of Australia's fundamental interests. It is important. The Government should applaud our views on this matter. Australia has a lot of economic and strategic interest hanging on the successful conclusion of these negotiations. For a start, the territorial sea will cover 12 miles and not three miles, as is now the case. In addition, there will be a 200-mile economic zone which will give us effective, if limited, sovereignty over an additional million square miles of territory off the Australian coast which undoubtedly is rich in mineral, hydrocarbon and marine resources. It will guarantee freedom of passage for our merchant fleet and navy through international straits and archipelagic waters and it will provide for internationally regulated and ordered exploitation of the resources of the high seas and deep sea bed which will be not only to our advantage but also to the advantage of underdeveloped and poorer countries. There will also be protection and preservation of the marine environment.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Opposition can think of nothing more important than that element. But, in the process of expressing our views, I advert to the fact that the Government has given away a lot of its national interest by legislating domestically in an area which I think might well tie the hands of our negotiators in the international conference if they are asked whether their own Government has passed legislation pursuant to its sovereignty virtually to give title for the offshore areas to the States. We are not here to berate the States but, if we are at a negotiating table, at least we ought to be consistent in our views. If, in the national interest, the Law of the Sea Convention is adopted speedily, for the reasons I have mentioned, how ridiculous we would look because the territorial sea for the first three miles would belong to the respective States and the next nine miles would belong to the Australian national government. That is how inconsistent our legislation is. In regard to the protection of the marine environment against dumping, there will be no legislation to restrict dumping outside the three-mile limit but if we adopt the Law of the Sea Convention we will not have that constraint. It is important that we clearly make the point now that, unless something is done urgently, we will face continual delay. There is some suspicion that the Reagan Administration deliberately decided not to go ahead with the adoption of the Convention because of certain financial interests in the United States which were concerned about a restriction on seabed mining.

         â€”Oil companies. If that is the position, it is reprehensible conduct. We have to say so forcefully because, if 150 countries of the world can agree, why is it that the major superpower can say that it has to have another look at it? It does not help its own interests from the point of view of its leadership in the world and it will not engender support from many of the nations that have spent so much time trying to rationalise the many problems associated with these measures. We regard the whole of the Law of the Sea Convention as extremely important. Many of the world's resources are connected with the sea and difficult questions concerning the balancing of interests between national and international considerations must be resolved. We pay tribute to our own representatives who have played such a splendid part but we ask again: How tenuous is their situation if we have a divided national position and not a united international standing? In other words, we are saying internationally that we want the Law of the Sea Convention to give clear sovereignty to our Australian nation; yet, as I have said, in the process we have become prone to fragmenting the many parts of this Convention. A number of countries have three-mile territorial seas, a number have 12-mile territorial seas and a number vary considerably. The territorial seas of one country vary between three miles and 12 miles. One can see immediately that, if we are to talk about international control and the effective rationalisation of resources and their development, we should at least have a clear, unanimous decision such as we would have had if the United States had agreed to the most recent Convention. I say in the strongest terms possible, that, if the United States cannot see its way clear to agree to this Convention at the next sitting, it will be deemed to be one that should not be pursued any further. To delay it further would create the suspicion that it was not wanted in the first place. I think that would be quite a tragedy for the world and it would create serious difficulties for Australia and all other nations involved.

        â€”by leave-The purpose of this statement is not to announce a decision by the Government on Australian participation in the proposed force-Australia has still not yet formally been invited to participate in the force-but to set before the House the facts and information additional to that available when I last spoke on this subject on 14 May, and to indicate the issues which the Government will take into account in reaching a decision. Honourable members will be aware that the focus of Middle East peace negotiations over the last three and a half years has been the process begun by President Sadat when he visited Jerusalem and addressed the Knesset in November 1977. President Sadat's unprecedented and dramatic visit to Jerusalem led to negotiations between Egypt and Israel, with the United States also involved, which culminated in the Camp David Accords in September 1978 and the Egyptian-Israeli peace treaty of March 1979.
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       Essentially the Camp David Accords and the peace treaty can be divided into two parts. The first dealt with the Israeli occupied territories of the West Bank and Gaza and set out a procedure for implementing 'full autonomy' for the inhabitants of those two areas after the establishment of an elected self-governing authority. The Government regrets that progress on this aspect of the peace process has been disappointingly slow. Nevertheless this aspect of the peace process, while proving extremely difficult to implement, has helped to isolate the issues involved and has contributed to a greater understanding, by those outside the Middle East as well as those directly involved, of those issues. It must be emphasised that the undertakings concerning the return of occupied territory in the Sinai must be met if progress on these complex issues is to be made. The Government, for its part, believes that successfully carrying out the accords as they relate to the Sinai could be crucial in influencing those sections of the Arab world which have strong reservations about whether the complex problems of the Middle East can be resolved by means other than conflict.
      </para>
      <para>
       Undoubtedly the major achievement of the peace process has been the bilateral peace treaty between Egypt and Israel. This has proved that Israel and an Arab country, despite 30 years of bitterness and war, can negotiate a substantive peace agreement involving basic concessions on both sides. There is no doubt that as a result both Israel and Egypt have received substantial benefit. Israel's security interests have been enhanced substantially while Egypt has regained a good part of the Sinai and is now able to concentrate on domestic economic reconstruction. This is a significant achievement and must not be put at risk. Progress on the second part of the accords, the bilateral aspects of the peace treaty, has been good. Diplomatic relations have been established, Ambassadors exchanged and civil aviation, commercial, telecommunications and other links have been established. In addition, and most importantly from the Egyptian perspective, Israel has withdrawn from approximately two-thirds of the Sinai. Egypt now controls all of the Sinai west of an interim line running from El Arish in the north down to Ras Muhammed on the southern tip of the Sinai. Annex 1 of the peace treaty stipulates that Israel will complete its withdrawal from the Sinai 'not later than three years from the date of exchange of the instruments of ratification of this treaty'. Hence by the end of April 1982 Israel is scheduled to have withdrawn completely from the Sinai. It is quite clear from the text of the treaty that Egypt, Israel and the United States envisaged that United Nations forces would supervise both the Israeli withdrawal from the Sinai and the implementation of the security arrangements agreed on in the treaty. Article VI of Annex 1 stipulates the role and functions of such United Nations forces.
      </para>
      <para>
       Since the signing of the Egyptian-Israeli peace treaty in March 1979, the United Nations has been unable to give any mandate which would enable UN forces to operate in a peacekeeping role in the Sinai. The United Nations Emergency Force-UNEF-which was carrying out peacekeeping operations in the Sinai ceased operations in July 1979 when the Soviet Union indicated that it would veto an extension of its mandate. Honourable members will be aware that an Australian helicopter unit was based at Ismailia as part of UNEF. The United Nations Truce Supervisory Organisation-UNTSO-to which a number of Australian officers are seconded, still has about a dozen or so observers in the Sinai but could not be expected to assume the tasks of a Sinai peacekeeping force without a drastic revision of its mandate and a substantial increase in its numbers in the Sinai. Again it is clear that the Soviet Union, which has consistently opposed the Camp David Accords and the peace treaty, would not agree to an extension of UNTSO's mandate. In recent months there have been informal discussions in the United Nations about the possibility of obtaining a United Nations peacekeeping force to oversee the final Israeli withdrawal from the Sinai and to implement the peacekeeping functions as envisaged by the treaty.

       On 21 April the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs of Egypt, His Excellency Kamal Hassan Ali, requested the President of the Security Council to initiate, as a matter or urgency, consultations with members of the Security Council. The purpose was to explore the role of the United Nations, and specifically whether the Security Council would monitor and supervise the withdrawal of Israeli forces from Egyptian territories, and participate in the reciprocal security arrangements through the establishment of the force and observers, provided for under the Egyptian-Israeli peace treaty. On 18 May in a letter to the Egyptian Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs, the Japanese President of the Security Council, Mr Nisibori, replied to the effect that following consultations with individual members of the Security Council, including the Soviet Union, the members of the Security Council were unable, for various reasons, to reach the necessary agreement to facilitate the withdrawal of the Israeli forces and to participate in the security arrangements provided for in the Egyptian-Israeli peace treaty. I seek leave of the House to incorporate in Hansard the letter from the Egyptian Minister for Foreign Affairs, Kamal Hassan Ali, to the President of the Security Council and the President's reply to the Egyptian Minister.

      <para>
       Ever since the inception of the United Nations, the organization has been called upon to ensure the maintenance of peace and security in the Middle East. At this time, when serious attempts are being made to bring the Middle East closer to a comprehensive peace, it is legitimate to expect that the United Nations, particularly, the Security Council whose primary responsibility is the maintenance of international peace and security, should continue its established practice in undertaking its constructive role to ensure the durability, and consolidation of peace and security in the Middle East.

      <para>
       The Security Council was seized with the situation in the Middle East since armed hostilities erupted, on November 22, 1967 the Council unanimously adopted resolution 242, a resolution which is considered the universally agreed basis for a just and comprehensive settlement to the Middle East problem. Security Council Resolution 242 (1967) required that the establishment of a just and lasting peace in the Middle East should include the application of both the following principles:

       In accordance with this resolution, the Secretary-General appointed a special representative to promote agreement and assist efforts to achieve a peaceful and acceptable settlement. Towards this end, the special representative submitted, on February 8th 1971 an aide memoire, to Egypt and Israel. The aide memoire called upon Egypt and Israel to enter into a peace agreement as a first step towards a comprehensive settlement of the Middle East problem. Such an approach was endorsed by the general assembly with increased majorities when it adopted resolutions 2799 (XXVI) and 2941 (XXVII).
      </para>
      <para>
       In this context, Egypt and Israel concluded a peace treaty on March 26th 1979 and registered it with the Secretary-General on 15 May 1979 in accordance with article 102 of the charter. Consistent with the underlying principles and basic provisions of security council resolution 242 (1967) the treaty stipulated that Israel will withdraw its armed forces behind the international boundary between Egypt and Israel by April 1982. Within this context and to ensure the durability and further consolidation of peace and security, Egypt and Israel agreed to reciprocal security arrangements and a request that the United Nations provide forces and observers.
      </para>
      <para>
       In the light of the above, the government of the Arab Republic of Egypt views it timely for the Security Council to consider, on an urgent basis, the modalities for carrying out the required responsibilities for ensuring peace and security in the Middle East.
      </para>
      <para>
       Towards this end, my government has instructed me to approach your excellency, with a view to consulting the members of the Security Council in order to ascertain the role of the United Nations, and specifically whether the security council, would undertake to facilitate the withdrawal of the Israeli forces from Egyptian territories and to participate in the reciprocal security arrangement herein referred to through the establishment of the force and observers provided for in the Egyptian-Israeli peace treaty.
      </para>
      <para>
       In this connection, it may be important to confirm that Egypt's request emanates from its solemn commitment to the principles of the charter of the United Nations, from a deep conviction that the presence of the United Nations is the most appropriate formula for ensuring the maintenance of peace and security, and that this request falls within its sovereign rights in liberating its territories and pursuing a policy aimed at establishing a just, comprehensive and lasting peace in the Middle East.

        â€”I deeply regret that the letter of the President of the Security Council effectively rules out, for the immediate future at least, any United Nations involvement in the withdrawal of Israeli forces from the Sinai under the terms stipulated by the Egyptian-Israeli peace treaty. United Nations involvement in this crucial area is therefore not an option. The House will be aware that Security Council Resolution 242, which was agreed on after the 1967 Middle East war, called for an Israeli withdrawal from occupied territories. Egypt has expressed the hope that a non-United Nations multinational force will only be of a temporary nature and that the way should be kept open for its replacement by a United Nations force at a later stage. Against the possibility that the United Nations would not agree to fulfil the role envisaged for it, President Carter in letters dated 26 March 1979 to both President Sadat and Prime Minister Begin undertook, and I am quoting directly, 'to ensure the establishment and maintenance of an acceptable alternative multinational force'. I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard the letters from President Carter to President Sadat and Prime Minister Begin.

        â€”It has been suggested that the formation of such a force is not a part of the Egyptian-Israeli peace treaty accords. Nothing could be further from the truth. President Carter's letter is and remains an essential document accompanying the peace treaty ratified by both Egypt and Israel. The failure of the United Nations to fulfil the role envisaged for it in the peace treaty represents the basis for the current endeavours by Egypt, Israel and the United States to fulfil their obligations to the peace treaty through the establishment of an alternative multinational peacekeeping force.

       In the absence of any effective United Nations peacekeeping force the United States concluded an agreement in September 1979 with both Egypt and Israel on interim arrangements in which the already existing Sinai Field Mission, which is an American establishment, staffed by American civilians, would continue its monitoring functions in the Sinai. The Israelis whilst agreeing to these arrangements made it clear that they were acceptable only in the interim period while they still had a substantial force stationed in eastern Sinai. It is essential that the Parliament understands that Israel regards the establishment of an effective peacekeeping force as an integral part of the Treaty, indeed as an essential prerequisite for their final withdrawal from the Sinai.
      </para>
      <para>
       Put bluntly, in the absence of United Nations involvement, failure to form an effective multinational force would risk provoking a refusal by Israel to withdrawal from the final third of the Sinai. The consequences of such a refusal cannot be overemphasised. It would be a very severe, if not catastrophic, blow to the Camp David peace process and the Egyptian-Israeli peace treaty. Beyond this, and in the absence of any progress on the crucial Palestinian issue, it could imperil future prospects for attaining a comprehensive, negotiated peace in the Middle East. Further, It would seriously dent the faith of two nations which, after decades of conflict and death, have deliberately chosen the path of peace through negotiation and compromise as an alternative to mutually ruinous conflict.
      </para>
      <para>
       The fundamental reason why Israel agreed to withdraw from the Sinai was that a satisfactory set of arrangements to guarantee its security had been agreed upon. These arrangements quietened Israel's legitimate fears about its security and gave it the confidence to take the decision to withdraw. With an effective peacekeeping force in place in the Sinai, Israel's southern flank will be secure. It is the Government's hope that in these circumstances the Israelis would move with greater confidence to negotiate on outstanding issues affecting the future status of the West Bank and Gaza, including the right of the Palestinian people to a homeland.
      </para>
      <para>
       Since President Sadat's visit to Jerusalem in November 1977 he has pursued bold and imaginative policies in the cause of a negotiated settlement with Israel. Any failure to implement fully the provisions of the peace treaty could react adversely on Egypt's ability to carry out its commitments. Moreover, the uncertain and volatile situation in Lebanon reinforces the urgency of dissipating, by peaceful means, the atmosphere of suspicion and conflict which has dominated the Middle East for so long.
      </para>
      <para>
       Amongst the factors which will be taken into consideration by the Government if and when a formal approach is made to Australia to participate in a multinational peacekeeping force in the Sinai are: First, that Australia's overall interests are served by maintaining the momentum for the peaceful resolution of conflict in the Middle East. Secondly, the Government will need to consider the means available to maintain the momentum for peace. As I stated earlier, the inevitability of a Soviet veto has once again effectively removed United Nations involvement from consideration. Thirdly, is the proposed multinational peacekeeping force in accordance with the Camp David Accords and the spirit of United Nations Resolution 242, both of which enjoy the unreserved bipartisan support of this Parliament? Fourthly, can the Government support the formation of such a force? Finally, if Australia is formally invited to participate in such a force, are the conditions of participation such as to warrant consideration of Australia's involvement?
      </para>
      <para>
       Australia has established a record of participation in international peacekeeping operations, both within and outside the United Nations context, which the people of Australia can be justly proud of. By their very nature peacekeeping operations involve risks. The safety of any Australian force associated with the proposed peacekeeping operation in the Sinai, as well as the possible effects on our overall interests in the Middle East, would weigh heavily in any deliberations by the Government. The factors outlined above accurately reflect the present level and current state of the Government's thinking. I emphasise again, as I did in my statement on 14 May, that any communications between Australia and the parties concerned can be described as being only exploratory at this stage. Even as I address the House today negotiations proceed between Egypt, Israel and the United States about the membership, structure and detailed functions of such a force.
      </para>
      <para>
       In my statement to the House on 14 May, I said that the Government believes that such an exploratory approach is both justified and prudent in the present circumstances. It was in accordance with this exploratory approach that in response to an earlier message from the United States Secretary of State I wrote to Mr Haig, on 27 April. In my letter I pointed out that the Australian Government's preference remained for a United Nations peacekeeping force. I referred to allegations in the media in this country and the United States that the proposed multinational force would have a role beyond the Sinai itself. I also referred to speculation about the future use of air bases located in that part of the Sinai which Egypt is scheduled, under the terms of the peace treaty, to recover in 1982. I stated that it was important to dispel such suggestions.
      </para>
      <para>
       I noted that before the Australian Government could make any commitment to participate in the force it would have to be assured that other participants would give the force a broad geographical and political balance. Moreover, I pointed out that Australia's relations with the Arab world will have to be taken into account. Whilst almost all of these governments have opposed the Camp David peace process they have not been opposed to all aspects equally. I said that the Government would welcome advice about the command structure of the force, its controlling authority and the proposed relationship between that authority and the force. I sought information about the financing of the force and asked for advice about the proposed duration of any commitment, mentioning that it would obviously be difficult for the Australian Government to consider an open-ended commitment. Finally, I mentioned that because the force would be operating on Egyptian and Israeli territory, any formal approach to Australia should be extended by those two countries.
      </para>
      <para>
       As I stated earlier, it has become apparent from the information we have obtained that there are a number of aspects of the proposed multinational force on which final agreement has not yet been reached. Negotiations are still continuing, and whilst I understand that Egypt, Israel and the United States are close to agreement, the final details of the force are still to be concluded. I ask the House to keep this in mind.
      </para>
      <para>
       On 19 May the Secretary of State replied to my letter and dealt with some of the general concerns and provided answers to some of the specific questions I had raised. Additionally, Australian officials both here and overseas have sought, and are continuing to seek further information concerning the proposed Sinai force. It is apparent from the Secretary of State's letter to me, that the United States Administration shares the Government's view on a wide range of issues related to the force. Like us, it believes it to be important that a sufficient range of countries participate to ensure that the force is not narrowly based politically or geographically. The United States believes that Third World participation is important. We understand that a number of countries from Asia and Latin America are currently being approached to consider participation and we expect states from other parts of the world, including Europe, to be invited in due course.
      </para>
      <para>
       Secretary of State Haig has clearly stated that the only role of the proposed force is that of peacekeeping in the Sinai. He assured me that any contribution of the United States contingent is for the specific purpose of peacekeeping. Furthermore, the peace treaty states that the airfields in the Sinai will be transferred to Egypt for civilian use upon Israeli evacuation, and that these facilities will be under full Egyptian sovereignty and control. The mandate for the proposed force will be Article VI of Annex 1 of the peace treaty. The Government understands that details concerning the command and control arrangements, as well as the composition of the force including its civilian elements are still being negotiated. The Government will require further information on this aspect. This would include details concerning, for example, mechanisms for resolving disputes between the parties, and other aspects of co-ordination.
      </para>
      <para>
       The parties are presently negotiating the establishment of a peacekeeping force of a size sufficient to carry out the functions agreed by Egypt and Israel. Precise details are being worked out at this time. As we understand current thinking, the force is likely to consist of about two thousand men. In addition to infantry battalions, it is envisaged there would be a need for support elements including logistics and communications units. One or more of these elements might be provided by one of the countries contributing to the infantry battalions, or they could come from different states altogether. As was envisaged in the peace treaty, it is anticipated that units of the force will be located in the north in the Rafah area and at Sharm Al Shaykh. The contingents would man check points and observation posts and operate patrols in Zone C as defined in the peace treaty. The observers would perform verification functions in Zones A, B and D.
      </para>
      <para>
       The financial arrangements are yet to be finalised, although the hope has been expressed that those contributing states that are in a position to do so will contribute their services, or some part of them, free of charge. The duration of participation by contributing countries remains unclear. It is not expected, however, that national contingents will be required to serve indefinitely although there is likely to be a requirement that an acceptable force be maintained in the Sinai so long as either party believes it to be necessary. Current planning is based on the hope that various contingents would agree to serve for a specific duration.
      </para>
      <para>
       As I mentioned earlier, the reaction of other Arab countries will also be important to us. Their major disagreement has been over the mechanism for solving the Palestinian issue which they regard as the core of the Middle East issue. They have not taken exception to, nor do they dispute, Egypt's right to regain its territory from Israel. This, I believe, is a major distinction when considering likely Arab reaction to possible Australian involvement in a multinational Sinai peacekeeping force.
      </para>
      <para>
       In setting out the above details I have sought to give as full an account as possible of the current state of play concerning the proposed peacekeeping force. I emphasise again, that at this stage Australia has not been invited to participate and I have already referred to the negotiations which are still proceeding between Egypt, Israel and the United States. It is clear, nevertheless, that Australian participation would be welcomed by those countries and that it may only be a matter of time before a formal invitation is extended to Australia.
      </para>
      <para>
       I believe it would be appropriate to make a further brief mention of Australia's interests in the Middle East. In my statement on 14 May I explained that whilst Australia has limited influence in that area our interest in the maintenance of stability in that region is not limited. The Government believes that this interest is best served by the process of agreement through negotiation and compromise rather than recourse to war. For many years Australia has had important links with the Middle East. These links included our dependence for many years on the Suez Canal as a major trade route to the Mediterranean and Europe. Thousands of Australians fought in Egypt, Libya, Palestine and Syria in two world wars in the cause of peace and, over the last 25 years thousands of migrants from Arab countries have settled in Australia in search of peace. In more recent times this country has contributed with distinction to peacekeeping operations under United Nations auspices in this region. An opportunity now exists for Parliament to express its views on whether Australia has a possible further role in the same cause. In this context I quote from the speech of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Hayden) on 21 September 1978, Hansard page 1308, in which he said, inter alia:
      </para>
      <para>
       Camp David has been a first step but a critically important one. President Carter's initiative in convening the meeting, and his political skill and courage in keeping it going, have created the essential momentum for the next steps, which may well be even more difficult. Our hope is that all the parties, and others who must necessarily become involved now, will maintain the momentum.
      </para>
      <para>
       Further in his speech he stated:
      </para>
      <para>
       The Prime Minister's statement on this matter is a carefully considered one, as is proper in such a complex, sensitive and important matter. I commend him for that and assure him, this House and the nation that on this great matter genuine concern for the achievement of lasting peace in the Middle East is a matter of bipartisan commitment.
      </para>
      <para>
       In conclusion, I hope that, on such an important issue, the debate will be a well informed and rational one. The Government is hopeful that it will be possible to maintain a bipartisan approach towards the Camp David Accords, the Egypt-Israeli peace treaty and the need to maintain the momentum for peace in the Middle East. I present the following paper:

        â€”The Opposition notes the remarks made by the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Street). We wish to place on record the fact that we are of the opinion that a statement would not have been made at this stage if we had not raised this matter in recent weeks in this Parliament seeking information as to what transpired by way of negotiations between the Government and the United States. The Minister referred to the remarks made by my colleague, the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Hayden) which are deemed to be, and were, supportive in 1978. We wish to make it very clear that the remarks made in 1978 were made in the context of what the Camp David Accords might have been expected to achieve. Obviously, the framework for the achievement of any solution in that area was with the United Nations Security Council acceptance of the Camp David Accords, and the approval of any force in that area by the United Nations Security Council, not only in accordance with the Accords but also in accordance with the treaty and the framework attached thereto. We can place on record that none of that has been achieved. It is a bit improper to suggest, by quoting the Leader of the Opposition's remarks out of context, that we can now say: 'There should be a bipartisan attitude in this matter'.
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       I want to deal at length with some of the matters. In fact, let me advert to remarks made at the time of the signing of the Camp David Accords. No Arab head of state supported the Camp David Accords or spoke out in support of Sadat. We also have the position, in accordance with the framework, that the factors to be taken into account, says the parties, are in accordance with Security Council resolutions 242 and 338 in all their parts. Those resolutions, as all honourable members know, relate to the fact that the question of peace and stability in the Middle East is to be under the control of the United Nations, and the United Nations Security Council in particular. In fact, the representative of the United Nations was to report periodically as to the progress of the peace negotiations and the peace implementations. Further, the Minister adverted to the Palestinian problem. Let me refer again to the framework for the Camp David Accords. It is stated:
      </para>
      <para>
       Egypt, Israel, Jordan and the representatives of the Palestinian people should participate in negotiations on the resolution of the Palestinian problem in all its aspects.
      </para>
      <para>
       Is it not a fact that the Minister's statement raises many more questions of a very serious nature than it purports to answer? Let me deal with them. I refer to the question of the United Nations participation in the Middle East. When I raised the matter in this House and subsequently in statements outside the House, I referred to the importance of the fact that the Camp David Accords of 1978 and the peace treaty of 1979 clearly specified that the United Nations was to play a role. Even more than that, Article VI, paragraph 8 of Annex 1 of the peace treaty unequivocally stipulated that the United Nations force could not include permanent members of the United Nations Security Council, that is, it could not include troops from either of the super-powers-in other words, troops from the United States of America and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics were barred. I believe it is abundantly clear that adequate efforts have not yet been made to secure a United Nations force and that there is still a great deal of room for positive diplomacy in which Australia should actively participate.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Minister made reference to such efforts. Let us have a look at the facts. The Minister said that there had been informal discussions in recent months. We must ask why only in recent months? It is over two years since these agreements were concluded. In terms of concrete moves in the United Nations, the position is even worse. Let me emphasise this point. The best that the Minister could do was to refer to approaches made on 21 April, a few weeks ago, and on 18 May, a few days ago. Those are the only approaches made to the United Nations. This is incredible!
      </para>
      <para>
       Are we really being told that formal approaches were made only in the last couple of weeks to have the United Nations participate in the major role which was clearly envisaged for it some two years ago? I am aware of the earlier efforts of the United Nations Emergency Force-UNEF-and the United Nations Truce Supervisory Organisation-UNTSO. I am also aware of the role which has been played in southern Lebanon by the United Nations International Force in Lebanon-UNIFIL.
      </para>
      <para>
       When we talk about Lebanon, let us place on record that it is only a matter of miles away from this area with which we are concerned. There is the greatest hostility there. The Lebanese community in Australia is divided on the basis of war taking place around Beirut, the problems of the Syrians and their missiles and the question of the Israeli's suggesting that they will take immediate action against the missiles. This is all taking place a matter of a few miles away from the area we are talking about. The point I am making is that the international community, including Australia, should make every effort to secure United Nations participation in the present phase, if that is at all possible.
      </para>
      <para>
       Let us have a look at the Camp David Accords of 1978 and this suggestion of President Carter's letters being part of the 1979 treaty. If we look closely at the Camp David Accords we realise several things. In the Minister's speech he quoted President Carter as undertaking:
      </para>
      <para>
       . . . to ensure the establishment and maintenance of an acceptable alternative multinational force.
      </para>
      <para>
       That was done by way of a letter of 26 March 1979. The Minister might also have quoted the preceding sentence which committed the United States to:
      </para>
      <para>
       . . . exert utmost efforts to obtain the requisite action by the Security Council.
      </para>
      <para>
       I believe that there is room to do this. Australia should independently be exerting efforts in that direction.
      </para>
      <para>
       What is more important is the question of the relationship of the letter to the treaty and the Accords. I do not think the Minister is well advised in this matter. He said that the establishment of an American led force is 'part of the peace treaty and accords'. It is not. It is very clear, if we look at the Accords and the treaty, that it is prohibited.
      </para>
      <para>
       Firstly, I make the point that, whilst the letter was written on the same day the peace treaty was concluded, it is in no way a formal part of the treaty. Secondly, and more importantly, we cannot have an ancillary document to an international treaty which contradicts the treaty and still claim that it is part of the treaty. Let me repeat that Article VI paragraph 8 of Annex 1 of the treaty provides for the forces to be drawn from countries other than either of the super-powers.
      </para>
      <para>
       Further, and equally importantly, Annex 1 continues:
      </para>
      <para>
       The parties have agreed as follows:-
      </para>
      <para>
       With respect to the provisions of paragraph 8 Article VI of Annex 1 if no agreement is reached between the parties they will accept or support a United States proposal concerning the composition of the United Nations force and observers.
      </para>
      <para>
       But the letter contradicts the treaty on both points. It not only envisages a non-United Nations force but also a force led by the United States-one of the super-powers. Everywhere we look-in the 1978 Camp David Accords, in the 1979 peace treaty and in Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338-the reference is always to a United Nations force.
      </para>
      <para>
       Thirdly, the Minister claims that President Carter's letters are essential documents accompanying the Egypt-Israel peace treaty. This is not the case. There is no evidence for that claim; indeed, there is evidence to the contrary. The treaty states that the papers which are attached to the treaty are protocol, annexes and maps. It in no way refers to letters-in particular, the Carter letters to President Sadat and Mr Begin. Those letters are clearly not part of the treaty. Therefore, there can be no reliance placed on them by this or any other government as a legal basis for supporting a non-United Nations force.
      </para>
      <para>
       The key point in the Minister's statement comes at page 14 of his advance text. The Government's case in making a decision to contribute to forces to Sinai will have to rest on this point, but the point is false. The Minister says that the mandate for the proposed force will be Article VI of Annex 1 of the 1979 Egypt-Israel peace treaty. In fact, there is no mandate in that article for anything but a United Nations force.
      </para>
      <para>
       One can read and re-read Article VI and read and re-read the peace treaty and the Camp David Accords. In Article VI, which the Minister claims to contain a mandate for a non-United Nations force, there is no mention of anything but a United Nations force. There are nine paragraphs in Article VI. In those nine paragraphs there are no fewer than nine references to a United Nations force. There is no reference whatsoever to any other force but a United Nations force. There is not one sub-clause which does not refer specifically to such a force. How then can the Minister claim that Article VI of Annex 1 of the treaty is a mandate for the proposed force? In fact, there is no mandate. If there is no mandate the Minister should admit it. It is irresponsible to claim a mandate where it does not exist. It is misleading to claim a mandate when none exists. It is misleading this House and the Australian people to claim a mandate where none exists.
      </para>
      <para>
       I refer to the attitude of the Arab world and west European countries. The Minister said in his statement:
      </para>
      <para>
       The Government, for its part, believes that successfully carrying out the Accords as they relate to the Sinai, could be crucial in influencing those sections of the Arab world which have strong reservations about whether the complex problems of the Middle East can be resolved by means other than conflict.
      </para>
      <para>
       I do not think that is a fair statement. Firstly, it implies that those sections of the Arab world which have strong reservations about the Camp David Accords believe that armed conflict is the only solution. That is just not true. That it is not true is amply and dramatically illustrated by the fact that the Western European allies of the United States are searching at this very moment, and have been for the last 15 months, for an alternative to the Camp David Accords because they believe that the Accords do not provide a realistic answer. To put it at its lowest, there are very serious questions not only in the majority of the Arab states but also in the capitals of Western Europe about whether the Camp David Accords any longer provide a realistic solution.
      </para>
      <para>
       As to the attitude of the Australian Labor Party, after the conclusion of the Camp David Accords the Australian Labor Party conference welcomed the signing of the treaties as an important step in the search for a just, comprehensive and lasting peace. We emphasise the importance of United Nations Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338, which referred to the role of the United Nations. Further, we emphasised that both the Israelis and the Palestinians are entitled to independent states and homes of their own. The Labor Party welcomes steps towards peace in the Middle East, but we must be sure before we commit Australian troops that we are really involving ourselves in a process which will be constructive and not one that could easily heighten tension between the super-powers and the countries of the region and possibly drag Australia into the maelstrom of fighting in the Middle East.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Minister claimed that the Government has made no decision. It is quite clear from his statement that, as was the case with Vietnam, this Government is anxious to get involved. Let me point out to the Minister the sort of public reaction any decision to send Australian troops to the Middle East is likely to receive. Editorial writers and commentators in at least six of the largest newspapers have spoken directly or indirectly against this venture, and I suggest that they are espousing the views of the Australian people, irrespective of their politics. They are conservative newspapers and commentators who in the past have supported the overseas adventures of conservative governments. This time they are showing that, unlike the Government, they have learned from past mistakes. These leaders and shapers of public opinion include the Age, which has pointed out:
      </para>
      <para>
       . . . all of Egypt's fellow Arab nations are opposed to the Camp David pact and that many of the Europeans see the Accords as bankrupt and inadequate to the task of moving towards comprehensive peace.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Canberra Times stated:
      </para>
      <para>
       There is no good reason why Australian forces should go all the way to the Middle East just to prove that this country is an ally of the United States.
      </para>
      <para>
       It added:
      </para>
      <para>
       Australia ought not to encourage Washington to think that it may be able to assemble under its own sponsorship an international force which is independent of the UN. Australian policy should work independently for the UN force which the Egypt-Israel treaty envisaged.
      </para>
      <para>
       In the Sydney Morning Herald, Mr Guy Harriott said:
      </para>
      <para>
       I think we should not touch the Sinai force with a forty foot pole. It is simply too much of a risk.
      </para>
      <para>
       Mr Harriott added:
      </para>
      <para>
       South East Asia is within Australia's sphere of direct interest; the Middle East is not . . . I thought that argument had been settled in the early 1950s when Menzies was reluctantly forced to concede that Australia's strategic concern was no longer primarily with the Middle East and the Suez Canel, but with our own region.
      </para>
      <para>
       Many similar comments have been made elsewhere. I have quoted those today because they are sound and sensible expressions of view, and to warn the Minister of the cristicism he will face and the storm that will burst about him if his Government decides to send Australian troops to the Sinai. The Minister's statement shows that the Government is set on that course. In the 1960s and 1970s the rice fields and jungles of Vietnam proved to be a political and military quagmire for the United States and Australia. Why should we venture back into that quagmire? In the 1980s this Government again seems ready to risk the same sorts of difficulties.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Minister indicated in his speech some of the factors that will be taken into consideration by the Government if a formal approach is made, and I should like to consider those for a moment. Firstly, he said that Australia's overall interests should be served by maintaining the momentum for the peaceful resolution of the conflict in the Middle East. The Labor Party agrees, but we believe that we must be extremely careful about the vehicle we choose before we become involved. The Minister went on to refer to the Camp David Accords and United Nations Resolution 242. I have already pointed out that those documents refer only to a United Nations force. The Minister asked: Can the Government support the formation of such a force? (Extension of time granted). I suggest that on an issue of such importance to the country, and given our tragic history of involvement with the United States in Vietnam, a more appropriate question would be this: Can the Government and the Opposition support the formation of such a force? Let us consider Namibia. Already we have committed a peacekeeping force of some 300 in what we hope will be the resolution of the dispute between South Africa and the South West African People's Organisation. The Government has not yet explained how we will discharge both obligations, and again I come to the point that both forces will be far from our shores and, apparently, under somebody else's command. At the same time, we are pulling out our forces at Butterworth and apparently rationalising our military commitments in the immediate region.
      </para>
      <para>
       In conclusion, I have made it clear that the Labor Party has a sincere and fundamental commitment to peace in the Middle East on the basis of involvement of the United Nations, as envisaged in the Camp David Accords, and with due regard to the principles laid down in United Nations Security Council Resolutions 242 and 238. I have also made it clear that the proposal being considered by the Government cannot be said, from the point of view of either international law or political reality, to be in any sense a proposal which involves the United Nations. The Opposition believes that in these circumstances the proposal is fraught with danger and may well contribute to the escalation of tension in the Middle East rather than to a real solution of the problems of that tortured region.

        â€”Yes. The Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Street) in his statement to the Parliament some minutes ago quoted extracts from a speech I made in this Parliament in September 1978-nearly two years ago-at page 1308 of Hansard. They were comments of a somewhat hopeful expectation on the basis of the outline of the Camp David Accords as we understood them and, more particularly, in terms of the actual Accords as we were made aware of them. I shall not go over the ground that has been well developed by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, the honourable member for Kingsford-Smith (Mr Lionel Bowen). I shall refer merely to Article 6, which exclusively develops a series of points. Essentially, they boil down to the joint commitment between Israel and Egypt that the disengagement, the settlement, will be based on United Nations involvement, United Nations forces. At that time we certainly were not made aware of any unilaterally provided letter by the United States of America. However, in that respect the point should go on the record that the Camp David Accords are between Israel and Egypt and do not concern the United States, which was only a witness. A letter from a non-party to an agreement can scarcely be regarded as forming part of that agreement in the legal sense. I do not wish to dwell on that any further.
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       The final point I wish to make is that I am concerned about the condition of the Camp David Accords. I believe that they are sagging badly and are in danger of imminent collapse because of the poisoned atmosphere in relation to the West Bank and Gaza, which has been contributed to by the policies of the Begin Government. Since the signing of the Camp David Accords 39 settlements have been established in the area. I conclude by quoting the words of Agriculture Minister Ariel Sharon, which appeared in the Washington Post on 28 September:
      </para>
      <para>
       You just can't do anything about it any more. That is why it is impossible any more to talk about the Jordanian option or territorial compromise. We are going to leave an entirely different map of the country that it will be impossible to ignore. I don't see any way any government will be able to dismantle the settlements of Judea and Samaria.
      </para>
      <para>
       Therein lies the nature of so many of the difficulties with which we are confronted and the reason for many of the reservations which have been expressed not only by the Opposition but also, I believe, by every editorialist who has written on this subject and, from what I can see, the informed commentators too. It is a shame.

       <para>
        The standard of health of Aboriginals is far lower than that of the majority of Australians and would not be tolerated if it existed in the Australian community as a whole.
       </para>
       <para>
        This is the main finding of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairs in its report on Aboriginal health. The same message comes through in two other reports now before the Government: The National Trachoma and Eye Health Program and the Government's own program effectiveness review on aboriginal health. Both show that the health of Aboriginal Australians is unacceptably low. The Government agrees with this assessment and reaffirms its objective of raising the health status of Aboriginals to that of the rest of the community. The hard fact is that while we have channelled many millions of dollars into Aboriginal health and health-related programs, and in spite of all our efforts-and despite some improvements which have occurred-the level of Aboriginal health is still unacceptable.
       </para>
       <para>
        Whilst there have been some improvement in the health status of Aboriginals, health services alone cannot provide the solution for all the problems nor are they the responsibility of any one government. The problems will have to be overcome by a co-operative and co-ordinated effort involving many arms of the Commonwealth and State governments as well as Aboriginals themselves and their representative organisations. It is important that we look at what we are doing and ensure that we are not just providing services and nothing more. We must evaluate existing programs to ensure that they are directed towards, and actually do result in, an improvement in Aboriginal health and social well-being. To this end, Commonwealth support for Aboriginal health programs will be made conditional upon a set of specific goals and objectives which include Commonwealth Aboriginal affairs policy, being drawn up for each program, against which its attainment can be measured.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government has received timely offers of assistance from professional health organisations. The Royal Australasian College of Physicians, whose members have undertaken much of the original research on respiratory, cardiovascular, renal, metabolic and paediatric problems among the Aboriginal population, considers that Aboriginal health is a major social issue in which its involvement could be increased. The Australian Medical Association has also expressed its concern and offered assistance. The Government appreciates the interest shown by these and other professional bodies and intends to pursue the offers, particularly in relation to evaluating health services to Aboriginals.

       <para>
        There have been numerous reports on Aboriginal health. They have all painted much the same picture. I turn now to the background of the three reports which the Government has considered. The House of Representatives Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairs received references on Aboriginal health from the House of Representatives on 1 December 1976 and 10 March 1977. On 16 March 1978 the then Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, Mr Ian Viner, gave the Committee its terms of reference. I seek leave to have them incorporated in Hansard.

         â€”I thank the House. Having taken evidence through submissions, public hearings and community visits, the parliamentary Committee presented its report on 20 March 1979. The trachoma report was prepared by the Royal Australian College of Ophthalmologists. It describes the most extensive screening, diagnosis and treatment coverage of eye disease ever undertaken in this country. The field teams involved in the National Trachoma and Eye Health Program also detected and arranged treatment for a variety of other illnesses. The report was presented to the Parliament by me on 1 April 1980. A program effectiveness review was conducted by Commonwealth officials during 1980 to determine, as far as possible, the health status of Aboriginals and the effectiveness of current Aboriginal health programs and of other programs which affect Aboriginal health. The review team drew information about the programs from Commonwealth departments and took into account the findings of the two reports I have already mentioned as well as other related reports. The officials also visited Aboriginal communities and consulted with people directly involved in community-based health care programs. The officials' report was completed during 1980.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        Main Findings of the Reports
       </para>
       <para>
        These three reports are obviously interrelated and it is appropriate for the Government to consider them together in its response to the parliamentary Committee's report. They contain common fundamental concerns and recommendations but differ considerably in detail. We have, therefore, felt it necessary to give careful attention to the major themes of each and the various proposals advanced. The reports all confirm three things:
       </para>
       <para>
        The unsatisfactory health status of Aboriginals; the urgent need to improve the environmental conditions affecting Aboriginals' health; and the importance of increasing Aboriginal involvement in the design, control and delivery of health care services.
       </para>
       <para>
        Environmental Improvements
       </para>
       <para>
        Each report referred to the need to increase efforts to improve the environmental conditions in which many Aboriginals live. Much of the ill health experienced by Aboriginals is directly associated with a substandard physical environment. The parliamentary Committee recommended that 'the highest priority be given and immediate action taken to provide clean and adequate water supplies to all Aboriginal communities'. The trachoma report found in rural Australia that when the hygiene of Aboriginals approached that of non-Aboriginals so did the prevalence rate of the diseases measured. So for those people living in unhygienic conditions it recommended that appropriately designed and equipped houses be provided and that houses should contain a water supply to cater for all necessary uses and should also have efficient water-based sewerage systems and garbage disposal facilities. The officials' report also recommended that greater priority be given to the provision of housing, water supply, sanitation and electricity.
       </para>
       <para>
        The disruption of Aboriginals' traditional lifestyle has given rise to a number of widespread health problems, especially where Aboriginals have been obliged to live on reserves or settlements, camps, or in rural or urban areas, under conditions of poverty. The problems include poor water supplies, dangerous sanitary conditions, overcrowding and limited access to nutritious food. The spread of illness and disease has been facilitated, especially respiratory, ear and skin infections, and intestinal parasite illnesses. The disruption of their society and lifestyles and its effects have also produced despair, chronic disadvantage and alcohol abuse. This situation is not amenable to short term solutions. Government programs over many years have sought to improve services and facilities in such ways as will encourage Aboriginals to assume responsibility for decisions about their lifestyles and their futures. The effort must be maintained and expanded while the problems remain as serious as they are.
       </para>
       <para>
        Once preventive measures begin to take effect, succeeding generations will not be saddled to the same extent with the wide spectrum of diseases-eye, ear, respiratory, gastro-intestinal, skin, et cetera-that are less frequent in the non-Aboriginal population. Of course, in the meantime, health services play an important role by alleviating distress and improving the quality of life. It is our intention that all children, including Aboriginal children, will have a much better start to life than has been the case for so many in the past and which is so important in the long term for improved health status.
       </para>
       <para>
        Aboriginals themselves have stressed the prime importance of adequate housing. That priority has been, and continues to be, reflected in the programs of the Department of Aboriginal Affairs. For example, since 1975-76, the Government has provided $298.2m for Aboriginal housing, including hostels. During the last full financial year, 1979-80, 1,632 houses were built or purchased for Aboriginals and 205 home loans provided throughout the States and the Northern Territory with Commonwealth funds totalling $59.9m. The last Budget provided in excess of $72m for Aboriginal housing and accommodation. These substantial increases in funds for Aboriginal housing show how determined we are to respond to Aboriginals' own priorities.
       </para>
       <para>
        The figures give the lie to uninformed claims that funds have been cut. The Government has considerably expanded funds for Aboriginal housing and accommodation even while these reports have been under consideration. Those increased funds are flowing into this priority area of need. We have not delayed action; we have accelerated it. Much remains to be done and we do not deny that. But the Government's achievements in Aboriginal housing are substantial and are growing each year. In fact, in some States, the time is now within sight when the housing backlog will have been overtaken.
       </para>
       <para>
        Increasing attention is also being given, within the Department of Aboriginal Affairs allocation, to programs administered under the general heading of community management and services for municipal-type services to Aboriginal community organisations, reserves and settlements. Here our role has been essentially a topping-up of State and local government activities. However, the Commonwealth expects the States and the Northern Territory also to honour their responsibilities towards their Aboriginal citizens. Aboriginal people, like other citizens living in a particular State or Territory, are entitled to expect basic municipal services to be provided by State or local government. The Commonwealth has done much to help overcome past neglect, but it is not, and should not be regarded as, the only source of funds for providing services to Aboriginal people. Whilst we expect the State and Territory governments to take up this challenge, we understand that a special effort will be needed. That is what the Government had in mind in committing an extra $50m over five years for environmental health improvement.
       </para>
       <para>
        I mentioned earlier that the efforts which have been made have not always been as effective as we would have liked. The Government is looking to shared funding arrangements under this program in a joint Commonwealth-State effort to eradicate at least the worst of the environmental conditions under which many Aboriginal communities in rural and remote areas live. Finding, storing and distributing clean water supplies and installing waste disposal systems are costly exercises. We must get our priorities correct and make sure that Aboriginal communities' priorities are fully known. The technology used must suit the community environment. Good planning here may take time, but it will pay off. It will be necessary to co-ordinate planning for the environmental improvements which are needed so that we can determine which projects should be funded under this program in terms of national as well as community priorities. The Commonwealth intends to discuss these matters with relevant State Ministers and with Aboriginal representatives. I expect that there will be a range of subsequent discussions involving officers. The Department of Aboriginal Affairs has a regular program of consultation and co-ordination with State authorities and with Aboriginal organisations leading up to the preparation of its program for each financial year. At that Department's request, some proposals have already been identified for additional environmental health projects in the normal Budget process for 1981-82. Again, we have not waited or delayed action. The job is under way and we want to accelerate its progress, in co-operation with State and local authorities and with their financial support.
       </para>
       <para>
        In considering projects for inclusion under the new program, we will be looking to concentrate the additional funds on those larger-scale water supply and waste disposal projects which have the highest priority of need but which are difficult for the Commonwealth or the States to accommodate in their normal ongoing budgets. Special needs arise in the increasing number of small outstation communities in traditional areas. It is not appropriate in these cases to provide permanent major capital works which would disrupt the preferred lifestyle. We are much encouraged by reports received that the health and well-being of Aboriginals at outstations is, on the whole, an improvement on the health of those people in the past. Nevertheless, the Government believes there should be adequate water supply and waste disposal to supplement the provision of basic services by members of outstation communities. With major works being undertaken through the Environmental Health Program, relatively minor works which are also of high priority will be able to be accommodated within ongoing programs, where increased emphasis is already being placed on such measures.
       </para>
       <para>
        Aboriginal Involvement in the Planning and Delivery of Services
       </para>
       <para>
        We know that conventional health services have real difficulties in winning the confidence of Aboriginal people. That confidence and familiarity are essential to effective and early use of health services. The reports before us all confirm that services which Aboriginals perceive as remote or impersonal have not been acceptable and therefore are not effective in tackling their serious health problems. Because non-Aboriginals share the culture and outlook of most health personnel and have a lifelong familiarity with the institutions and values of mainstream society, we find it difficult to understand the alienation of many Aboriginals. This is particularly true of our health system, which is strongly based on scientific research, institutional care and professional structures. I have not yet mentioned the daily reality and the historical experience of disadvantage, the evidence of which Aboriginals see all around them. What they see compounds the problems and makes our task in Aboriginal health a uniquely demanding one. We must do everything possible to strengthen Aboriginal responsibility and participation.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government therefore wishes to see, and will actively work towards, a marked increase in the degree of Aboriginal involvement in the control, management, design, delivery and evaluation of health care programs affecting Aboriginal people. The Department of Aboriginal Affairs has been involved in supporting Aboriginal health care services through two channels: Assistance to the States to provide an adapted general service more appropriate to Aboriginal needs and more accessible by Aboriginals; and the funding of Aboriginal organisations to provide health services run and controlled by Aboriginals for Aboriginals. More recently, my own Department has also assisted some established Aboriginal medical services by payment of health program grants designed to meet salary costs of clinical staff. These services have tried to close the gap between the general medical services and the health needs of Aboriginals.
       </para>
       <para>
        Whilst we want to encourage the development of programs which serve the whole community, rather than segregated services, our fundamental objective is the improvement of Aboriginal health, using the most effective means available. We will need to monitor carefully the impact of the Government's proposals on the effectiveness of the various means of service provision. There is not only a need for Aboriginals to be better informed about the availability of health services, to understand the services, to feel confident in approaching them and to feel at ease in using them, but also a very real need to improve the understanding and empathy of non-Aboriginal staff who supply the health services and control the facilities. Finally, the services must modify and adapt themselves to Aboriginal values and needs-we must not make the assumption that only Aboriginals must change.
       </para>
       <para>
        The parliamentary Committee recommended that 'Aboriginal cultural beliefs and practices which affect their health and their use of health services . . . be fully taken into account in the design and implementation of health care programs'. The Government supports this view. The people best equipped to advise on relevant cultural beliefs and practices and the appropriate adaptation of health services are Aboriginals themselves. They are also best equipped to undertake important bridging roles in health service delivery. Their responsibilities in the health care services which they use must be rapidly expanded.
       </para>
       <para>
        In supporting Aboriginal health programs, the Commonwealth will require greatly increased Aboriginal involvement in the design, control, management, delivery and evaluation of services. There is a need for the States and the Northern Territory to provide greater opportunities for Aboriginals to play significant and expanded roles. To achieve this goal, increasing numbers of Aboriginals will have to be trained for, and employed at, all levels. Aboriginals must also take a real and decisive part in policy and program decision-making. The way each State government meets this goal may be different. We are firmly committed, however, to ensuring that the goal is met, and we will be taking these questions up with State Ministers. In the same spirit, I should like to mention that some State colleagues with responsibilities in Aboriginal affairs have, in the past, expressed their concern that, in administering programs on behalf of the Commonwealth, they may not have enough flexibility. For example, they may wish to reallocate funds to reflect changing circumstances. The Commonwealth would be prepared to examine this problem with any of the States which wish to redirect priorities towards mutually-acceptable policy goals, and especially Aboriginal involvement.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is unacceptable that, at the present time, there are no qualified medical practitioners of Aboriginal descent, and insufficient numbers of Aboriginal people qualified for other professional and para-professional roles. We propose to have discussions on a number of fronts to make sure Aboriginals have greater opportunities in these areas. It is vital that Aboriginal doctors, nurses, administrators, nurses' aides and other health care staff should be available. We acknowledge that the necessary education and training will take time. In the short term, however, we can also look at redefining existing practical responsibilities of Aboriginals presently employed in health care. Both the States and the Aboriginal medical services need to be involved in the provision of opportunities through the National Employment and Training System and other programs. Nor should the role of traditional healers, who are intimately involved in services in traditional communities, be overlooked. Opportunities must be found to make use of their particular skills, which can be built on or adapted according to circumstances. We shall continue to give strong support to the employment of Aboriginal health workers, who have important preventive and primary care roles to perform, now and in the foreseeable future.
       </para>
       <para>
        Availability and Awareness of Choices
       </para>
       <para>
        Most of us would take it for granted that we can choose the kind of health care we think appropriate. The parliamentary report makes it clear that more needs to be done to make a range of choices known and available to Aboriginal people. One difference between Aboriginals and other groups in Australia is that Aboriginal people are not fully aware of the range of health care options available. The parliamentary Committee recommended that 'Aboriginal communities be given the opportunity to determine the type of health service that will best suit their needs and available resources.' We endorse this view and commend it to State governments. The Government will propose to the States and the Northern Territory discussions between officials, and with Aboriginal people, on this matter of choice. These discussions will be looking for a co-operative basis for increasing Aboriginal awareness of the health service options and expanding the opportunities for Aboriginal communities to influence the types of services provided to them. This is a fundamental commitment and one which is supported by each of the reports on Aboriginal health to which I have referred. In fact, the Commonwealth and Victoria and Aboriginal organisations are now co-operating in a State government working party which has these very objectives. There is also scope for improving the relationship between general practitioners and Aboriginals, and increasing the use of primary care services by Aboriginals.
       </para>
       <para>
        I mentioned before Commonwealth grants to Aboriginal medical services. These organisations provide primary health care services which are acceptable and accessible. Some of them have also begun to provide preventive services and ancillary programs in response to community needs, expressed through the close involvement of many Aboriginals in the services. The Aboriginal medical services are a fine example of Aboriginal initiative and of readiness to assume responsibility to improve their own health status. The Government endorses their valuable role in this field and commends also professional co-operation between Aboriginal medical services and State services so that their work is complementary. The Aboriginal and Islander Medical Service in Darwin, which is funded jointly by the Commonwealth and Northern Territory governments and works in closely with existing health services, is a good example of what can be achieved through co-operation. The Government will be prepared to consider provision of assistance to similarly innovative approaches elsewhere.
       </para>
       <para>
        We shall, of course, continue our existing support to Aboriginal medical services. We shall also consider, together with the States and Aboriginal people, the expansion of complementary community-based services where they offer the most effective form of health care, and work towards an expanded range of options for primary medical care. Aboriginals must be involved to the fullest possible extent in selecting the most appropriate health care options. This policy is consistent, the Government believes, with a cardinal principle of the Government's health policy, that people should have freedom of choice in an integrated and comprehensive system. That is something the Government wishes to see for all Australians, not the least of whom are the Aboriginal people.
       </para>
       <para>
        The officials' report had proposed that future funding arrangements should be focused away from State programs to Aboriginal medical services. The proposal envisaged this being done at a predetermined rate or by reference to a set formula. The Government looked carefully at the proposal. We considered these issues when we were drawing up the new arrangements for general health care funding and administration. Conscious of the fact that many Aboriginals are dependent, to some extent, upon the States' general health care systems, we took the view that we should direct more effort into encouraging the States to involve Aboriginals in the planning and provision of all health services to their people. In the case of Aboriginal medical services, of course, this is already a settled matter.
       </para>
       <para>
        Aboriginal Advisory Body
       </para>
       <para>
        The Commonwealth, for its part, in demonstrating that Aboriginal involvement is so central to Government policy and so crucial to improving Aboriginal health, will seek ways of ensuring that it received the best possible advice from Aboriginals in relation to Aboriginal health matters. We acknowledge the advice that has been provided from time to time by the National Aboriginal and Islander Health Organisation, a federation of Aboriginal medical services. However, we also wish to have a more formal arrangement for advice on the whole range of health and health-related problems and needs, including medical needs. We shall therefore discuss, with the National Aboriginal Conference, arrangements to ensure that the Government receives appropriate and comprehensive advice about Aboriginal health, through the Conference. It would be fitting for the National Aboriginal Conference, as an all-Aboriginal elected body, charged with that responsibility of transmitting the views and advice of Aboriginals to the Government, to undertake this special task.
       </para>
       <para>
        The parliamentary report recommended that a new unit be established in the Department of Aboriginal Affairs. It was proposed that a group of experts on middle level technology should be set up to advise on, amongst other things, the most practical means of providing communal and household facilities in Aboriginal communities. The Department of Aboriginal Affairs is essentially a policy co-ordination and funding body. It does not have specific functional expertise but rather draws on the resources of other departments or agencies when professional advice is needed. The same is true at the State and local levels. Where necessary, private consultants may be engaged. The Government considers, therefore, that it would not be appropriate or necessary for the proposed special group to be located within the Department of Aboriginal Affairs.
       </para>
       <para>
        A second proposal was for an evaluation team to have responsibility for maintaining a check on the effectiveness of Aboriginal healtha care services and programs, and for the provision of standardised statistics on Aboriginal health. The Department of Aboriginal Affairs has in its central office structure an evaluation branch, which conducts evaluations as an entity distinct from the rest of the Department. That branch will be able to participate, as it has in the past, in evaluation of programs and projects, in close consultation with Aboriginal people. The Department of Aboriginal Affairs will continue to draw on resources already available, including those in other specialist departments as the need arises in undertaking evaluations against defined objectives. It will be seen, therefore, that the objective of the Standing Committee is capable of achievement under present arrangements.

        The officials' report recommended that a national system of Aboriginal health statistics be developed along the lines proposed by Dr L. R. Smith. It recommended that the Department of Health allocate, as a matter of priority, the necessary resources for the system's implementation. The lack of a uniform, national data collection system, to provide an accurate measure of Aboriginal health status, is a deficiency which cannot be allowed to continue. In order to assess the effectiveness of Aboriginal health programs, including those which will take into account the measures I have outlined, it is essential that we measure Aboriginal health status on a uniform basis. As a matter of priority, I propose to implement a uniform system of national Aboriginal health statistics through the Department of Health. Such a system is absolutely essential for monitoring and evaluation of effectiveness. There have been discussions with State and Northern Territory authorities on this matter in recent years and the co-operation of the States and the Territory will lead to its speedy achievement.

        Finally, mention must be made of the valuable work done by the National Trachoma and Eye Health Program, undertaken by the Royal Australian College of Ophthalmologists. The report highlights many adverse conditions suffered by Aboriginals which both Commonwealth and State governments must rectify. It also graphically illustrates the relationship between environmental and other conditions suffered by Aboriginals and their health status. The Government supports the recommendations from the report for the continuation of the work commenced by the trachoma program and recognises that, without follow-up through both therapeutic and preventive intervention, much of the effort to date may be lost. We are, therefore, taking steps to ensure that the improvements in Aboriginal eye health achieved by the trachoma program are consolidated by means of effective follow-up and regular reporting.
       </para>
       <para>
        Commonwealth officials and representatives of the College have met with Northern Territory and Western Australian authorities and the College is hopeful that a re-screening and minor surgery program will be commenced in the Northern Territory shortly. Similar meetings are proposed with other State authorities. This program, supported by the Commonwealth to the extent of some $2m, has shown us how much improvement can be made, given a concentrated effort. The three reports highlighted prevalent illnesses to which this approach would be suitable. A further group of illnesses, because of their chronic nature-for example diabetes-would need to be the subject of long-term care programs. The Government will investigate the need for additional funds for national programs which will have a special focus on prevalent illnesses. We wish to have the advice of Aboriginal people and of the States in determining the needs, appropriate programs and priorities.

        Conclusion
       </para>
       <para>
        The matters I have touched on represent the Government's general reactions to the many points made in the three reports. We are determined to play our part in bringing about a substantial improvement in the health of all Aboriginal Australians. As I said earlier, our long-term objective is to raise the level of their health to that of the Australian community generally. This aim requires the co-operation of the State and Northern Territory governments, with which much of the responsibility lies. Of equal importance is the co-operation of the Aboriginal people themselves. Action must be taken now to provide the training needed for Aboriginals to assume wider professional and semi-professional responsibilities in health services and also to expand the roles and skills of existing health workers. This is in addition to the contribution which Aboriginals can and now should make to the planning, administration and evaluation of such services.
       </para>
       <para>
        We will be reporting to the Government in mid-1982. Therefore we propose immediately to open discussions with the States and Aboriginal organisations to explore ways of getting on with the job. While not denying the achievements to date, much still remains to be done. We are ready to play our part. I present a statement showing in detail the Government's responses to the House of Representatives Standing Committee's report on Aboriginal health. I seek leave to have it incorporated in Hansard.

        Endorsed. In addition to the ongoing programs of the Department of Aboriginal Affairs which provide housing, water, sanitation and other community services, the Prime Minister announced in his election policy speech a commitment to provide an additional $50m over 5 years to meet highest priority needs for water supplies, sanitation and other environmental improvements.

        3. 'An advisory group within the Department of Aboriginal Affairs comprising experts in middle level technology be established, and in consultation with relevant departments and the Australian Institute of Aboriginal Studies to research various options for the provision of community and household facilities; consult with Aboriginal communities to assess their needs; advise them on the most appropriate facilities that best suit their needs; monitor implementation of its advice to communities; facilitate employment of technical advisors by Aboriginal communities; and report to the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs.'
       </para>
       <para>
        Professional advice on appropriate technology is available to Aboriginal communities and organisations from relevant Government departments and, where appropriate, private consultants. As far as possible, these arrangements are decentralised, to ensure their responsiveness to communities. The Department of Aboriginal Affairs does not itself provide professional expertise and would therefore be an inappropriate location for an advisory body on technology.

       </para>
       <para>
        Housing accommodation or shelter is a high priority for Aboriginals, not only for those moving into or living in towns. Existing policy affirms the importance of Aboriginal involvement in decisions regarding the number, location, design and arrangement of housing projects. Priority is currently given to the provision of housing for Aboriginals living on reserves.

       </para>
       <para>
        Endorsed. Current policy supports the adaptation of services and programs to meet adequately the cultural beliefs and lifestyles of Aboriginals. The Government believes that the Standing Committee has correctly identified the major cultural factors affecting Aboriginal health. These will be specifically drawn to the notice of States and the Territory in the course of discussions on Aboriginal health program funding arrangements.

       </para>
       <para>
        The Committee's concern that State authorities should accept some financial responsibility for improving the health of Aboriginals is endorsed. The States have already been informed that the Commonwealth expects State Governments to provide at least a pro-rata share of general revenues for Aboriginals in their own programs and those supported by the Commonwealth, and to apply the 'priority of need' principle in all such programs. In the negotiations referred to in comments on recommendations 5 and 6, the matter of joint Commonwealth/State funding will be thoroughly discussed.
       </para>
       <para>
        8. 'An independent evaluation team responsible to the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs be established to evaluate the effectiveness of all Aboriginal health care services and programs in accordance with the World Health Organisation's definition of health and the principles of self-determination, and to establish suitable criteria so that standardised information can be collated and that funds be provided for the purpose where programs are funded by the Government.'
       </para>
       <para>
        It is agreed that there is a need to standardise criteria for evaluation and to collate information. The Government supports reviews and assessments of Aboriginal health programs, and expects that their conclusions will be used in the modification of existing services and the development of new Aboriginal health services.
       </para>
       <para>
        The idea of conducting evaluations against the World Health Organisation's definition of health and the principle of self-management is acceptable to the Government as a broad principle. The Government has reservations, however, about the usefulness of evaluations which are conducted without more specific terms of reference or criteria. These only provide evaluation criteria that are very broad and difficult to relate to the very large number of projects which may comprise 'all Aboriginal health care services and programs'.
       </para>
       <para>
        A structure already exists within the Department of Aboriginal Affairs to develop and co-ordinate assessments and program reviews. The Department has within its Central Office an Evaluation Branch which conducts evaluations as an entity distinct from the rest of the Department. The Committee's objective-the establishment of an independent evaluation team-is, therefore, capable of achievement under present arrangements. Aboriginals are to be involved in any evaluation.
       </para>
       <para>
        9. 'The full range of choice of the various types of programs delivering health care to Aboriginals be maintained and, where appropriate, support increased.'
       </para>
       <para>
        Endorsed. The degree of increased support will of course depend on available resources and on competing priorities in Aboriginal programs generally.
       </para>
       <para>
        10. 'Aboriginal communities be given the opportunity to determine the type of health service that will best suit their needs and available resources and that a Task Force be established to place the full range of alternative health care services before them.'
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government is committed to expansion of Aboriginals' involvement in all aspects of health services affecting them, including in the design, control, management, delivery and evaluation of health services for Aboriginal people. The Government supports the development or expansion of Aboriginal responsibility in relation to State Aboriginal health programs. The recent initiatives of the South Australian and New South Wales Governments in these aspects are examples. In the context of these developments, there is no need for a 'Task Force' approach. Nor does the Government see a centralised body as necessarily the best means of ensuring what the Standing Committee has in mind.
       </para>
       <para>
        11. 'An inquiry be held into the implementation of the policy of self-determination as it affects community development.'
       </para>
       <para>
        Not endorsed. The Government's policies aim at Aboriginal self-management and self-sufficiency. The Department of Aboriginal Affairs assesses, on a continual review basis, the impact of the Government's policies and programs in Aboriginal affairs on community development.
       </para>
       <para>
        12. 'Aboriginals be involved to the fullest possible extent in all stages of the provision of health care services and that the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs assess the number of Aboriginals required, the time it will take to train them to assume responsibility for the health of their own people and, to this end, develop, in consultation with relevant Ministers, suitable training programs.'
       </para>
       <para>
        The principle that Aboriginals should be involved to the fullest possible extent in the provision of health care services for them is strongly supported. The Government also supports the provision of suitable training, whether academic or on-the-job, to ensure the greatest possible Aboriginal participation in health care for Aboriginal people. The Commonwealth has funded training programs for Aboriginal health workers in State Health authorities and stands ready to discuss new initiatives.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government is particularly concerned to see the development of Aboriginal health professionals-doctors, dentists, nurses and para-professionals. Special measures may be needed to encourage Aboriginal students to go on to such training and Commonwealth Departments will take what steps appear appropriate.
       </para>
       <para>
        Beyond the measures needed to train and employ suitably qualified Aboriginal people as health professionals, there is also a need to employ Aboriginal people in administrative and clerical positions, at all levels in Commonwealth and State authorities which have responsibilities in relation to Aboriginal health. The Commonwealth Government has taken several steps to ensure these objectives are met and will commend a similar approach to the States.
       </para>
       <para>
        13. 'Training hospitals for nurses, university medical faculties and other tertiary institutions introduce into their curricula, both at undergraduate and graduate level, a component which deals with Aboriginal health.'
       </para>
       <para>
        Endorsed. Whilst some hospitals and medical faculties already provide courses or segments on Aboriginal health, there needs to be a concerted effort to ensure that Aboriginal health and related matters are adequately dealt with in medical training institutions. These proposals will be taken up and actively pursued with the Tertiary Education Commission and with appropriate medical learned societies.

        14. 'Comprehensive orientation courses be conducted for all non-Aboriginal staff recruited to serve in Aboriginal communities before commencing duty, that they receive regular inservice training, and that a formal diploma or certificate be provided by a tertiary institution for professionals actively involved in providing health care to Aboriginals.'
       </para>
       <para>
        Orientation and inservice training courses are already provided by most State and some Aboriginal organizations, but there is a need for more comprehensive and more regular training courses for non-Aboriginal staff. The proposal for a formal diploma or certificate course will be pursued in the discussions envisaged in relation to Recommendation 13.

       <para>
        Health personnel already receive the general standard allowances paid in recognition of isolation and residence in a tropical climate, but they do not receive, in their conditions of service, acknowledgement of the special difficulties they experience. Consultation with the States, Northern Territory and non-government organisations will be necessary.

         â€”It has taken the Government over two years to respond to the recommendations of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairs contained in the report on Aboriginal health which was tabled in this Parliament on 20 March 1979. It is interesting to note that the reference was given to the Committee by the then Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, Senator Chaney. As the report was directed to that Minister, I would have expected that a reply to the House would have been forthcoming from him. It is interesting to note that one of the implications that flows from the statement by the Government is that it now clearly sees problems of Aboriginal health not so much as the responsibility of the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Senator Peter Baume) but rather the responsibility of the Minister for Health (Mr MacKellar). That is not a view shared by the Opposition. For that reason, I am the principal spokesman for the Opposition on this matter rather than the shadow Minister for Health, the honourable member for Bonython (Dr Blewett).
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        In the course of events following the tabling of the House of Representatives Committee report, two other reports have been made. A trachoma report was presented on 1 April 1980 and in late 1979 the Government established its own Program Effectiveness Review Task Force to report on Aboriginal health. The Government has been sitting on the recommendations contained in the effectiveness review report since early last year. I believe that it says something about this Government's view of open government that because the program effectiveness review recommendations do not comply with the Government's predetermined attitudes under Fraser federalism, the document is not before the Parliament today. It is really extraordinary to contemplate that the Government will take a House of Representatives committee report containing a large number of recommendations and refer it for review. There is nothing wrong with that. A great deal of work was done by the effectiveness review committee but having regard to the importance of this matter, on what basis is it the case that the conclusions of that review committee are not directly available to the parties and not even available to the members of the House of Representatives Committee that produced the report?
       </para>
       <para>
        I wrote to the Minister seeking the comments of the review committee. They were not available to me, as they were not available, I suspect, to any other member of the Committee. In order to get my copy, I had to obtain it, as I suspect other members did, through a Government department leak. Why should a government which is genuinely concerned about Aboriginal health want to take that kind of secret attitude towards a further report which could only widen the nature of the debate, only make more information available to the House and only lead to put other recommendations which ought to be taken into account by the House in its concern to reach conclusions on this very important matter. For many Aboriginals in the community, this is not just a matter of Commonwealth-State relations or of supporting or opposing this Government. For many Aboriginals the kinds of recommendations in all the reports are very much a matter of life or death.
       </para>
       <para>
        I believe the reason that the House of Representatives has to debate the Ministerial statement today without the benefit of the recom- mendations of the Program Effectiveness Review Committee is that the recommendations of the Minister involve a very considerable and important shift in the nature of traditional Commonwealth responsibility towards Aboriginal citizens. The House of Representatives committee in its recommendations saw Aboriginal health programs, their innovation and support as being a primary responsibility of the Commonwealth. Of course, in the report comments were made about State and local government. If one looks at the full thrust of those recommendations, one will see that at no stage did any member of that Committee consider that both innovation and support, were not prime responsibilities of the Commonwealth. That is as it ought to be. That stems from the result of the 1967 referendum and from the view put very succinctly, I believe, to the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs by the Department of Aboriginal Affairs. Having regard to the fact that this submission was put to the Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs by the Department of Aboriginal Affairs one would be entitled to believe that that view also constituted the Government's view. I seek leave to incorporate that submission in Hansard.

        As a result of the referendum held in 1967, the Australian Constitution (section 51[xxvi]) now provides that the Parliament of the Commonwealth may pass laws 'in respect of people of any race for whom it is deemed necessary to make laws'. The States have concurrent power to legislate in this area but by virtue of section 109, Commonwealth legislation prevails over any inconsistent State legislation.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Commonwealth Government's policy in respect of Aboriginal affairs calls for the creation of opportunities by which the Aboriginal community may exercise control over its own affairs. In pursuit of this policy, the Department of Aboriginal Affairs has been encouraging the development of autonomous local Aboriginal community organisations which receive grant funds to enable them to carry out programs which will express and enhance their independence. Such assistance is a positive response to Aboriginal aspirations and without it the Aboriginal community and its individual members would remain dependent upon Government assistance indefinitely and have no opportunity to redevelop the necessary self-confidence to enable them to take their place as equals within the Australian community.

         Recent representations made to the Opposition have demonstrated that the Government has not met its promised commitments to Aboriginal health services, especially in respect of community-controlled, self-managed services, which are completely in accordance with the Government's stated policy of 'self-determination' for the Aboriginal people of Australia.
        </para>
        <para>
         It is apparent that, due to the Government's 'New Federalism' policy and a desire to sharply reduce Commonwealth spending that the Commonwealth's responsibilities (following the 1967 Referendum) are in danger of being abrogated in favour of the States.
        </para>
        <para>
         I now seek your unqualified assurance that it is not your Government's intention to shift responsibility for Aboriginal health funding wholly or partially to the States.
        </para>
        <para>
         I seek this assurance in view of two recent developments, namely:
        </para>
        <para>
         1. Strong pressures on Aboriginal health services to accept Health Program Grants (H.P.G.) from the Commonwealth Department of Health Community Health Division (in lieu of continued funding from the Department of Aboriginal Affairs); and
        </para>
        <para>
         2. The establishment of the Aboriginal Development Commission (which of course, has been given responsibility for Aboriginal enterprises run for profit, but has no charter to provide funds for non-profit public services).
        </para>
        <para>
         My attention has been drawn to the letter from the Director-General of Health to Aboriginal Health services (dated 17 October 1978, ref 78/11247) which stated quite clearly that:
        </para>
        <para>
         1. the acceptance of HPG's would prevent the continuance of bulk billing by doctors employed by these services;
        </para>
        <para>
         2. Aboriginal Medical Services would be given the option of accepting either bulk billing or HPG's; and
        </para>
        <para>
         3. there would be no compulsion on any service to accept HPG's.
        </para>
        <para>
         The Government is apparently still using the numerous reports on Aboriginal health which it has received ('Aboriginal Health', House of Representatives Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairs, 20 March 1979; National Trachoma and Eye Health Program Report, 1 April 1980; and the PER Report) to postpone adequate funding to existing services and new initiatives by Aboriginal communities in the area of health care delivery.
        </para>
        <para>
         Recent and current Commonwealth funding has been provided solely for primary (clinical) health care and education. This has meant that any service wanting to provide preventive health care programs has been forced to rely on private donations from individuals and local and international aid agencies.
        </para>
        <para>
         This is in direct contravention of the WHO/UNICEF 1978 Alma-Ata Declaration which, inter alia, recommended that:
        </para>
        <para>
         'All governments should formulate national policies, strategies and plans of action to launch and sustain primary health care as part of a comprehensive national health system and in co-ordination with other sectors.'
        </para>
        <para>
         The Alma-Ata Declaration also clearly defined the relationship which should exist between primary, preventive and other forms of health care delivery.
        </para>
        <para>
         The other assurances which I also seek are:
        </para>
        <para>
         1. The continued commitment of Commonwealth funding, via the Department of Aboriginal Affairs, to community-controlled Aboriginal health services; and
        </para>
        <para>
         2. The continuation of current bulk billing arrangements for those services who choose to use them, without prejudice to their Grant-in-Aid from DAA.

         â€”The letter simply emphasises the concern of the Leader of the Opposition on behalf of the Opposition and emphasises the importance of the Commonwealth, through its constitutional and fiscal responsibilities, seeing that self-managed Aboriginal health programs receive an appropriate level of funding. I believe that the shameful aspect of the Minister's statement to the Parliament today is that whilst recognising the unsatisfactory health status of Aborigines, the urgent need to improve the environmental conditions affecting Aboriginal health and the importance of increasing Aboriginal involvement in the control and the delivery of health care services, at every point the Commonwealth's own constitutional responsibility and moral obligations to our Aboriginal people are demeaned and those responsibilities and duties are subjugated to an appropriate State area. To put it more bluntly, what this Government is about is turning Aboriginal health care initiatives back to the States even though the Minister and the Prime Minister know that at least two States are on public record as perceiving self-managed Aboriginal health services-to use their own term-as a 'form of apartheid'. It is interesting to note the kind of logical slide contained in the Minister's own statement. Whilst supporting the concept as stated on page 8 of his statement, he described those very services as 'rather than segregated services'. That is the kind of logical slide between the view of some States such as Western Australia and Queensland which seek self-managed Aboriginal services as a form of apartheid and the kind of term used in the Minister's statement. When comparing the range of services, he gives support to a generality of such services but uses the very interesting phrase 'rather than segregated services', in regard to self-managed Aboriginal services. More than two years ago the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairs reported:
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        'The level of Aboriginal ill-health will only be reduced if there are dramatic improvements in the physical environment, if there is maximum participation by Aborigines in all stages of the planning and delivering of health care'.
       </para>
       <para>
        One year later the National Trachoma and Eye Health Program came to much the same conclusion, after practical experience in the field throughout Australia.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Program Effectiveness Review Task Force reached the same conclusion. Therefore there have been three reports, two of them public and one wrapped in a cloak of secrecy, which all reached the same conclusion.

        <para in-line="1">
         â€”Prior to the suspension of the sitting, I was making the point that the ministerial statement on Aboriginal health involved the diminution of Commonwealth initiative and a shift in emphasis towards the States. It also involved a shift in departmental control from the Department of Aboriginal Affairs to the Department of Health. In order to centralise the Opposition's concern on both these points, I wish to move an amendment to the motion 'That the House take note of the paper'. I move:
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        That the following words be added to the motion:
       </para>
       <para>
        'and that this House reaffirms-
       </para>
       <para>
        (1) the continuing constitutional responsibility of the Commonwealth to fund, and give continuing support to, the raising of the health standards of its Aboriginal people, and
       </para>
       <para>
        (2) the continued commitment of Commonwealth funding, via the Department of Aboriginal Affairs, to community controlled Aboriginal health services.
       </para>
       <para>
        I believe that amendment will give the House an opportunity to express itself in terms of the real issues that we believe arise from this ministerial statement.
       </para>
       <para>
        The underlying theme of the statement-it runs throughout it-presupposes that there is complete accord between the States and the Commonwealth on the objective for administering health services for Aborigines. That is not the fact. I can do no better in order to give a graphic illustration of the facts than to relate the history of Professor Hollows and the work that he did in the whole trachoma area. Quite apart from the events of the last few days, I am certain all members of this House, as well as the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, would acknowledge the very real task done on behalf of the people of Australia by Professor Hollows in dealing with the problems of trachoma amongst our Aboriginal people.
       </para>
       <para>
        By the time that program was over, the team had seen more than 100,000 people, some of them several times. More than 15,000 Aborigines had participated in month long treatment programs and more than 1,000 people had had eye operations, some performed in mobile hospitals erected by the Army. Eight million pieces of information had been collected and a computer analysis of the results demonstrated conclusively the environmental base of the disease. As Professor Hollows pointed out in his report, Aborigines were living outside the reach of present health care delivery systems, even where such systems were present. He often saw million dollar air-conditioned hospitals and clinics in the middle of the squalor of the Aboriginal camps. Professor Hollows has said that Aborigines were still alien and remote from those services.
       </para>
       <para>
        Professor Hollows' report, which was prepared for the Commonwealth Government, has been with the Government since April 1980. Since then the Department of Health has been trying to negotiate with the States the sort of continuing program that he called for. As the Minister for Health and the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs would know, the States have not complied. They have not been prepared to co-operate and they have made it clear that, even where they accept the findings of Professor Hollows, they want to run the programs themselves, irrespective of the international repute and capacity of Professor Hollows and his team. Professor Hollows has stated that the States want to do more of the same; they want to carry out programs which do not work and which will not work, and to freeze out the vital ingredient in any health care program that is concerned to uplift the standards of our Aboriginal people, that is, the critical question of Aboriginal participation. That was his experience and none of those arguments-compelling arguments they were, extracted in the field by a noted Australian authority-has been dealt with or even referred to in the ministerial statement.
       </para>
       <para>
        What does the Government's own bureaucracy say about Commonwealth-State attitudes to Aboriginal health? The program effectiveness review-whose report should have been in the hands of every parliamentarian in this House-was an internal review of the issues raised by both Professor Hollows and a parliamentary committee and referred to the critical question of Commonwealth-State co-operation in raising health standards. I wish to quote from this confidential document. It is no wonder that the Minister was not prepared to make it public. It shows the paucity, the mendacity and the nonsense which is involved in the ministerial statement. At page 14 of the review, carried out by departmental officers at the request of the Prime Minister, it is stated:
       </para>
       <para>
        The States have adopted a different stance about Commonwealth responsibilities, based on their interpretation of the agreements-that the Commonwealth is predominantly responsible for financing Aboriginal health programs, that the States are responsible for health policy and planning and for the co-ordination of health services, and that the States' general responsibility for health should not be abrogated by the Commonwealth's Aboriginal health policies.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is not clear how far the State authorities subscribe to the principle of Aboriginal self-management. Insofar as the principle may apply to States Grants programs, the States are adamant that policy, planning and management of health care must be undertaken by properly qualified personnel, and this tends to exclude Aboriginals because of their lack of training and particularly of formal qualifications.
       </para>
       <para>
        So, the Government's own internal bureaucracy agrees with the very conclusions that Professor Hollows made in the field. It has summarised those conclusions on page 15 of this confidential report.
       </para>
       <para>
        If members of Parliament want to get their hands on it and read it, they have to go cap in hand to the Press Gallery and say: 'Please, the Prime Minister regards this report as so confidential and so damning of his policies that we have to get it as if it had fallen off the back of a truck'. This policy document goes on to say:
       </para>
       <para>
        The PER saw three main areas of policy difference existing between the Commonwealth and the States:
       </para>
       <para>
        appropriate division of financial responsibility and the role of supplementary funding;
       </para>
       <para>
        co-ordination of policy and planning; and
       </para>
       <para>
        the emphasis to be given to Aboriginal self-management and the level at which Aboriginals should be involved effectively.
       </para>
       <para>
        This report complemented and supplemented the report of the parliamentary committee; but, more important than that, it came out with very specific proposals. It recommended:
       </para>
       <para>
        Effective Aboriginal involvement in developing and implementing health programs be a key factor. This would entail setting up a national Aboriginal health body responsible to the ministers for health and aboriginal affairs.
       </para>
       <para>
        Where is that to be found in the ministerial statement? It continues:
       </para>
       <para>
        That States be granted less funds and the Aboriginal run medical services be given much more.
       </para>
       <para>
        It could not be any more specific than that recommendation that the States be given less funds and Aboriginal conducted services be given more. But, that is not the principle we find in this ministerial statement. Further proposals are:
       </para>
       <para>
        That Aborigines be represented on hospital boards in areas with substantial Aboriginal population.
       </para>
       <para>
        That more Aborigines be employed in training in the Aboriginal health field.
       </para>
       <para>
        It goes on to say:
       </para>
       <para>
        More than $62m is spent on Aboriginal health in general State programs, including hospitals, but the report--
       </para>
       <para>
        This is the report of the Government's own advisers-
       </para>
       <para>
        claims that this is 'not effective'.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is not just a question of the proposals outlined by the Minister today being bad health policy. It is also a question of its being bad medicine. That is the reason this report has been buried and is not available directly to the Parliament so that it can form a consensus on it, so that it can go forward and deal with this critical problem, this matter of life and death which reaches right into every Aboriginal community in Australia.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government's own program effectiveness review has made it perfectly clear that the health status of Aborigines is still bad. The effectiveness and perpetuation of many current State-run programs is clearly open to doubt. It suggests that the Commonwealth, by funding the States in this way, is throwing good money after bad. It is interesting to note that the Minister, at page 11 of his statement, gives what he regards as the new model which the Government believes ought to be adopted. He said:
       </para>
       <para>
        The Aboriginal and Islander Medical Service in Darwin, which is funded jointly by the Commonwealth and Northern Territory governments and works in closely with existing health services, is a good example of what can be achieved through co-operation. The Government will be prepared to consider provision of assistance to similarly innovative approaches elsewhere.
       </para>
       <para>
        I do not propose in the short time available to me to be overtly critical of that service. I simply say this: The Aboriginal community was not consulted on the establishment of that service. I also point out that it is odd that in this very lengthy and substantial statement which refers to effective Aboriginal health care models, the Minister said that the new structure operating in Darwin was an excellent working model, when the Aboriginal community was not effectively involved in the decision to establish it. Not once in this very substantial statement did the Minister indicate as an effective working model-I name only one of them-the health service conducted by the Central Australian Aboriginal Congress in Darwin. It treats 30,000 Aboriginal patients a year at a cost of $12.50 per patient. The spokesman for the Northern Territory Administration, Mr Tuxworth, said that the cost to the Territory in a Territory-run operation is $40 per out-patient service. Should not this Minister say that perhaps we ought to be going for the service that seems to be working, which has the confidence of the Aboriginal people and which, most importantly, can be shown by the Aboriginal people to be run with cost savings and more effectively than the glitter and show of large structures which often are built to perpetuate the view of the prevailing State bureaucrat?
       </para>
       <para>
        I believe those are the issues. In considering this ministerial statement, not the least of the points we have to make is that the Minister has said: 'We should hand it over to the States. We will work it out together. It will be all right.' It might have been all right 12 months ago, but if there is any area in present Commonwealth-State relations where there is not merely chaos but confrontation on almost a daily basis it is health care. The Minister for Health from my own State, a man whose political philosophy is the same as that of this Minister, said only today that if Commonwealth funding continues at the present level Victoria will have to cut back on its health services. Is the Minister for Health serious when he brings in a proposal and says to the Minister for Health in Victoria: 'Despite the fact that you will have to cut back on services, we have an entirely new policy for the treatment of Aborigines which will cost you more than you are paying at the moment'? Have honourable members ever heard such palpable nonsense?
       </para>
       <para>
        It is not necessary that Government members support this statement. Perhaps it is not so important that the Parliament support it. But when we are talking about Aboriginal health care it is important that the Aboriginal people throughout Australia support the statement. What have they said about this report, this Minister for Health and this wretched Prime Minister? Mr Gary Foley, an Aboriginal who knows a great deal about Aboriginal health care services was reported in an article in the Press. He said:
       </para>
       <para>
        We are being trodden down, and every effort we make to improve the serious health problems of our people is thwarted by the Government.
       </para>
       <para>
        The article continued:
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government is refusing to fund 10 key Aboriginal-run medical services-at Campbelltown, Taree and Wilcannia (NSW), Geraldton, Broome, Warburton and Kalgoorlie (WA) and Rockhampton, Mackay and Cairns (Qld) . . . The Aboriginal medical services are the most cost-effective programs and the ones which, on the evidence of several Government reports, are doing by far the most and best work . . .
       </para>
       <para>
        No objective examination of those reports will contradict that statement. The article continued:
       </para>
       <para>
        All 32 staff, including seven doctors and dentists, of the Victorian Aboriginal Health Service have been working for seven weeks without pay because of a government-induced funding crisis.
       </para>
       <para>
        That crisis has been induced by this Government and this Prime Minister. The Minister for Health has made in the Parliament a lengthy statement telling the Aboriginal people that by the application of Fraser federalism all will be well. The Aboriginal people have reached, in the course of the last two decades, an understanding about their own rights, perspectives and self-dignity. They know the medical services in which they have confidence. More importantly, they know those services which reach out to meet Aboriginal needs and aspirations. This statement does not meet those aspirations, those hopes or the recommendations of the parliamentary committee. It does not fall within the purview of the Government's own internal review. It is a mediocre muddled statement which simply reflects the present trend of Fraser federalism. Just as that policy is failing in every other area it will fail the Aboriginal people of this nation.

       Customs Tariff Proposals No. 7 (1981).
      </para>
      <para>
       The Customs Tariff Proposals I have just tabled relate to proposed alterations to the Customs Tariff Act 1966. Proposals No. 7 (1981), which operates on and from tomorrow, contains tariff changes resulting from the Government's decision on recommendations by the Industries Assistance Commission in its report on wheelchairs. The Government has accepted the Commission's recommendations that the duty rates applicable to wheelchairs and parts will be reduced to 20 per cent over the next two years. This rate represents a duty reduction of 14 per cent for mechanically propelled and 16 per cent for manually operated wheelchairs. Before reaching this decision the Government gave careful consideration to the need to strike a balance between reducing costs for wheelchair users and providing a level and form of assistance appropriate to the existence of a viable local industry.
      </para>
      <para>
       I draw the attention of honourable members to the Government's announcement in the 1980-81 Budget of a new program under which a range of aids to daily living will be provided to disabled people. This program is intended to benefit disabled people not eligible under existing Commonwealth, Commonwealth-State or State funded programs. A range of aids including conventional wheelchairs, manual and motorised, will be available on indefinite loan under the program without cost to the recipients. The necessary administrative arrangements for this program are currently being developed under the authority of my colleague the Minister for Health (Mr MacKellar) with a view to the program commencing later this year.
      </para>
      <para>
       The proposals also contain changes which remove a tariff anomaly relating to raised nap cotton fabric known as flannelette. A new definition allows concessional entry of only genuine flannelette in accordance with a Government decision taken last year following the Industries Assistance Commission report on textiles, clothing and footwear. The new definition will ensure that cotton fabric with minimally raised nap falls within the quota system, as intended; but to avoid disruption to the industry making up bed linen, importers of raised nap sheeting which does not meet the flannelette definition will be issued with supplementary quota for the remainder of the quota period to 31 December 1981. A summary setting out the nature of the changes has been prepared and is being circulated to honourable members. I commend the Proposals to the House.

        This proposal is for the second stage of an overall modernisation program which is aimed at improving the effectiveness and efficiency of the dockyard and the fleet base, providing each with a capability of operating independently without duplication, improving the aesthetic qualities of Garden Island while minimising undesirable effects on the environment and preserving historic buildings. Advance works and stage 1 modernisation works at Garden Island have already been reported on favourably by the Public Works Committee and approved by Parliament. The stage 2 works will comprise: Woolloomooloo fleet berth wharves; west dock workshop modules B and C; guided missile launching system overhaul facility; conversion of building 30 to a ready-use store; conversion of buildings 89 and 90 to an office complex; production administrative centre and dock refit berth support facility; surface preparation and preservation facility and oily bilge waste treatment plant; groundworks, and reticulated engineering services. The estimated cost of the proposed works is $79m at April 1981 prices. I table plans of the proposed work.

         â€”In continuing my remarks on the Fish (Export Inspection Charge) Bill and the Dried Fruit (Export Inspection Charge) Collection Bill I reiterate what I believe to be the Government's reason for imposing these charges. This Government is intent on raising funds to add to its revenue or on cutting expenditure to achieve the same aim. That is what this Bill sets out to do. For the last four months I have sat in this House and listened to ideological rhetoric which could lead one to believe that the Government is about lowering taxes and charges. Nothing could be further from the truth. This measure, although only dealing in small amounts of money, is another measure designed to collect funds from two industries which can ill afford to pay the extra charges.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The Minister for Primary Industry (Mr Nixon) said that the purpose of the Bills is to have the fish and dried fruit industries pay half the costs of the services provided. The Bills set out the maximum amounts which can be charged. The previous speaker on the Government side, the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey), outlined the clauses of the Bills relating to these maximum charges. I will repeat them for the benefit of those who are listening at present. He said:
       </para>
       <para>
        Clauses 6 (3) and (4)-
       </para>
       <para>
        This is the Fish (Export Inspection Charge) Bill-
       </para>
       <para>
        give details of the maximum charges allowed under this Bill. They are 15c a dozen for oysters and 30c per kilogram for fish other than oysters. In the dried fruit levy Bill, clause 6 (2) also allows for differential treatment and clause 6 (3) sets the maximum charge under the proposed Act at $11 a tonne. However, fish and dried fruit producers should not be alarmed by the amounts referred to as these are truly the maximum charges.
       </para>
       <para>
        Fruit growers and fishermen would not want their livelihood to depend on this Government keeping any commitments. When the Government says at this stage that the charges are only 50 per cent it will be just a matter of time before we see a change. The honourable member for O'Connor also said that the maximum charges are introduced in line with the present policy and give a sensible life to the Bill. We could ask what he means by the words 'a sensible life to the Bill'. Virtually that means that any time in the near future when the Government sees fit, it can take necessary measures to collect the other 50 per cent thus doubling the charge in a very short time. Those are the policies to which he is referring. At this stage the charge is only 50 per cent of the services provided. No doubt, along with most of the other commitments made by this Government it will not be long before that will be changed and it will be charging the full 100 per cent.
       </para>
       <para>
        At this stage I would like to refer to a few other points concerning the fishing industry. Recently, the Australian Fishing Industry Council and the Victorian Fishing Industry Council were formed. The fishing industry has as much potential for development as any Australian food industry. The December 1980 edition of the official Commonwealth journal Australian Fisheries shows the value of fisheries production at an estimated $281m. Exports of Australian fisheries products to the year ended 30 June 1980 were worth a record $256m. It can be seen that this industry is worth a lot to the export income of this country. However, the journal states:
       </para>
       <para>
        Because of rising costs, particularly fuel costs, most fishermen were probably worse off in 1979-80 than in the previous year.
       </para>
       <para>
        This applies particularly to the many fishermen catching the high value species such as prawns and rock lobsters where neither catches nor the pace of price increases matched those of the previous year. So from the 1980 edition of the Australian Fisheries we see that there is not a great deal of room in the industry for the Government to be imposing extra charges at this time, particularly when we are constantly told by this Government that it is reducing taxes and charges. The very facts point to the opposite happening.
       </para>
       <para>
        In applying these charges to the industry the Government is adding to the already large increases in fees which at least one State government imposed at the end of 1980. I refer to the Victorian Government which increased fees for abalone divers and scallop fishermen by up to 100 per cent. Not only is the industry copping it from the Federal Liberal Government but also it is copping it from the Victorian Liberal Government. The fishing industry should be encouraged to expand. Whilst we are exporting fish to the value of $256m, we are importing fish to the value of $150m. The Government would be better advised to concentrate on fostering the industry as it has great growth potential which should be assisted by decreasing costs rather than unnecessarily increasing them.
       </para>
       <para>
        I do not want to take up a lot of the time of the House tonight. In the time that is available to me I just want to make a couple of comments. I find it rather alarming that, with only a couple of weeks of this parliamentary session left, we have 47 notices on the Notice Paper with many more to come in. Time will be vital. We will need it to discuss some of the more important issues. At this stage I would rather leave my remarks at what I have had to say and I urge the Government to bring forward and to debate some of the vital issues that the country is wanting to hear debated. I have said enough on this matter. The eight minutes which are remaining to me can go to a more sensible debate perhaps for a bigger industry.

         â€”Tonight I wish to deal with the Dried Fruit (Export Inspection Charges) Bill. (Quorum formed). The continual disruptions by the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mr Scott) indicate the importance the Australian Labor Party attaches to these primary industry Bills. The Dried Fruit (Export Inspection Charges) Bill and associated Bills allow for a maximum charge of $11 a tonne for the inspection of dried fruit. The actual charge being proposed by regulation in the Dried Fruit (Export Inspection Charges) Bill is $5.50 a tonne for 1981-82. These charges aim to recover some 50 per cent of the cost of inspection of dried fruit and will yield some $259,000 in a full year. The charges will operate from 1 July.

        The House will be well aware that this Government has made significant contributions to inspection services for primary industry as, indeed, it has made to research programs and promotion in many rural industries. I was interested to hear the honourable member for McMillan (Mr Cunningham)-perhaps we can excuse him because he has only been a member of parliament for four months-criticising the Government for the fact that it seeks to recover some 50 per cent of inspection charges. I have been a member of parliament for some nine years. I remember what happened after the report of the Coombs Royal Commission on Australian Government was presented to the Australian Labor Party Government. The beef industry was in its most serious depression ever. The Labor Government introduced a program for complete recovery of inspection charges for beef at that time. When we came into government it was necessary for us to abolish those inspection charges altogether.

         â€”Our Government abolished these charges on the beef industry altogether so that the very serious situation of the industry at that time could be resolved. I would like to make another point about this Bill: Where an industry is paying up to half of the inspection charges, I believe that it needs to be ensured and guaranteed that these inspection services are efficient and effective and that continual checks are provided to make sure that the amount of money that the industry is paying and the amount of money that the Government, through the taxpayers, is paying is being used in the best possible way.

        The Department of Primary Industry provides the export inspection services for the fried fruit industry. At the present time, there are some 29 DPI officers involved in inspection services. Most of these are stationed in the city of Mildura in my electorate of Mallee. Only a small number-two or three-are stationed in the ports of Adelaide and Melbourne. It is also interesting to note that in the dried fruit industry, Commonwealth officers perform both the domestic and export inspection services. The charges on the domestic side are accordingly given to the State governments to pay. I believe that this method of inspection could be applied to many more of our rural industries to overcome some of the duplication of costs and effort that occurs. Last year some 70,000 tonnes of dried vine fruit and 4,000 to 5,000 tonnes of tree fruit were involved in the inspection service. An average of 45,000 to 46,000 tonnes of dried fruit is exported each year. The cost of these inspection services is high. It has to be recognised that this cost represents only about one per cent of the value of all returns to the dried fruit industry.

        It always amazes me when a shadow Minister for Agriculture-in this case the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Kerin)-tends to talk down some of the smaller horticultural industries.

         â€”The honourable member for Werriwa did say that. I remember that when I entered this Parliament in 1972 the export value of a tonne of dried fruit was some $250. I remind honourable members that at the present time the price being received overseas for Australian dried fruit varies between $1,200 and $1,500 a tonne. I think this indicates the importance that this Government has placed on ensuring that adequate export markets are obtained and that industries are assisted in those markets.

       <para>
        Recently, I read a study by Edward Gibbon, The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, in which he concluded that all taxes must fall at last upon agriculture. Even in Roman times, apparently, agriculture was obviously affected as much by the changes in political and economic life as by the variability of nature. (Quorum formed). Whilst man has proved that he is the equal of nature in some respects, he is also proving that he can cause instability and insecurity in world agricultural markets. Of course, this situation is very much reflected in the Australian dried fruit industry. The industry's exports, particularly to the European Economic Community, have been very difficult to maintain. It is a credit to that industry, both as a strong organisational group and as a marketing body, that it has over the last decade been able to place its total fruit crop both in the EEC market and in other new markets throughout the world.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is, of course, of concern to the industry at the present time that Greece and Turkey are entering the European Economic Community, as both these countries are major producers of dried fruit. It is hoped that the subsidised arrangements that the EEC makes in respect of many of its agricultural products do not magnify and add to the difficulties that the Australian dried fruit industry has in placing its crops. The Australian dried fruit industry has retained its high reputation for quality and reliability of supply throughout the world. This has been done by a strong grower organisation in co-operation with government which has always sought to ensure high quality control through those inspection services that we are talking about tonight in the debate on this Bill. These services guarantee that our products are of a certain standard, both on the domestic and the export markets and, I believe, will ensure that this industry retains a very high reputation both here and overseas.
       </para>
       <para>
        As you are aware, Mr Deputy Speaker, the Australian dried fruit crop is not a large crop in terms of acreage or in terms of total economic value. But it represents an income of some $80m to $90m a year in areas that contribute very much to decentralisation, economic viability and growth in our rural areas. Whilst tonight I recognise that we are placing a higher inspection charge upon an industry, I do know that this industry is increasing in viability and is making a major contribution both to the areas in which it is produced and to the national economy overall. I have much pleasure in supporting the legislation.

         â€”As a serious student of Roman history, no doubt the honourable member for Mallee (Mr Fisher) would know that the fall of the Roman Empire eventually was brought about by the authoritarian and elitist policies of the power that be. I think there is a message there for the present Government. In dealing with the Fish (Export Inspection Charge) Bill, I would like to talk a little about the fishing industry. I represent the electorate which has the largest fishing industry in Australia. It is an industry that has tremendous potential for growth. It is my belief that this Government should be encouraging that growth. Clearly this Government, with the imposition of these additional charges, is not doing that. It is an industry that has potential for export earnings and, probably more importantly, a potential to reduce the level of our foreign exchange. Unfortunately the industry is today in chaos. I had calls from my electorate today from the town of Carnarvon where, due to the dumping of fish on the Australian market, the price of snapper has fallen below an economically viable level.

         â€”The countries are South Africa and New Zealand. I am not in favour of protection generally but this is a situation in which the Government should be supporting what is in fact an embryonic industry. It is an industry that is tremendously undercapitalised and an industry that needs to attract capital to improve the size and the quality of its fishing capability. This cannot be done unless there is some stability in the industry. This stability will not be enhanced by the effects of this Bill. One might wonder what will happen with the imposition of these extra charges to the presently flourishing abalone fishing industry.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        I think the tremendous difference between the policy of the Australian Labor Party and the policy of this present Government is worth bearing in mind. The Government does claim quite substantial income from royalties on the concessions for fishing within Australia's territorial waters. This Government puts that money into Consolidated Revenue. It is the policy of the Australian Labor Party to return that money to the industry, to make it available in the form of loans to the industry, so that fishermen can re-equip with better equipment and better boats to get out and compete with what is now a much better organised and a much better mechanised foreign industry. I think that illustrates the difference.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is said that the maximum charges will not be applied immediately. I do not think anyone seriously believes that. We have seen this present Government grabbing, in the most grubby fashion, at every available dollar. It will be only a short time before people are paying the maximum charge under this legislation. I have no doubt that, once that maximum charge has been reached, the National Country Party and the Government will be only too pleased to introduce another Bill to raise the prices further. One of the things that should be remembered is that the fishing industry is a primary industry. It is one of the great primary industries of this country. Therefore, it is a little surprising that, when we are debating this Bill which relates so much to primary industry, members of the National Country Party in this chamber are noticeable by their absence. I do not know why this is so. I think that something fishy is going on. I think people are beginning to realise-certainly this applies to the people in my electorate-that for many years the National Country Party has not been serving their interests. Quite honestly, I do not think there is enough substance to these Bills to warrant the length of time spent on them by the honourable member for Mallee.
       </para>
       <para>
        In conclusion, I say that we need to support this industry. It has the potential to reduce our foreign exchange. We are presently importing $150m worth of fish a year. This is a bill which could be substantially reduced. The industry could provide employment to a tremendous number of areas in Australia that today are areas of relatively high unemployment. Small country towns up and down the coast of my electorate would benefit substantially from a revitalised wet fishing industry. If the Government is serious about tackling unemployment-of course, I think it is a very big 'if'-this is one area in which a little consideration and the initiative that the Government is always talking about could be applied. The evidence is overwhelmingly present. With a little initiative and encouragement, the fishing industry in this country could develop substantially and could be providing substantial employment in areas which currently have a high level of unemployment.

         â€”As the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs (Mr Moore) has suggested, the Customs Amendment Bill and the Excise Amendment Bill are fairly parallel measures, and the Opposition is quite happy to proceed with a cognate debate. The first Bill, the Customs Amendment Bill 1981, amends the Customs Act in four principal ways. Firstly, there are provisions to clarify the powers of Customs to deal with illegal imports such as narcotics, and in fact those provisions follow the recommendations of the Williams Australian Royal Commission of Inquiry into Drugs. Secondly, there are provisions which clarify the powers and procedures of the Customs Bureau for clearing goods through Customs. Thirdly, the Bill invokes powers to the Bureau of Customs to deal with illegally imported vessels, particularly refugee boats which are condemned or otherwise unseaworthy. Finally, there is an amendment which aims to extend the validation period for tariff and excise proposals from the present period of six months to 12 months.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        I would now like to deal in detail with those four main areas. Firstly, the clarification and extension of the powers of Customs in dealing with illegal imports such as narcotic drugs is welcomed by the Opposition. These changes in part reflect the administrative directions already issued, following the abolition of the Narcotics Bureau in 1979. They are in accordance with recommendations of the Royal Commission of Inquiry into Drugs, which sought to delineate clearly the responsibilities of the Department of Business and Consumer Affairs on the one hand and the Australian Federal Police on the other. The Bill also provides for an extension of Customs control over ships and aircraft at sea from the present three miles to 12 miles from the coast. The Opposition supports those provisions. However, we note with some concern some of the implications of the changes, which obviously are much more extensive than those few words might suggest. The area of responsibility insofar as surveillance is concerned is extended by a factor in excess of four. As an example, to comprehend the difference between a 3-mile zone and a 12-mile zone, the area involved increases from about twice the size of Tasmania to about twice the size of Victoria. It is difficult enough to provide surveillance in compact areas of that size, but the fact that the area extends around the 36,735 kilometres of Australian coastline greatly exacerbates the problem.
       </para>
       <para>
        In answer to Opposition questions in the House of Representatives and recent Senate Estimates committees, we find that the surveillance effort of the Department remains very limited. I think it is a matter of some concern that the Government is not providing facilities for more extensive surveillance. There are only three Nomad aircraft-one at Townsville, one at Darwin, and one at Port Hedland. Notwithstanding that there are also capabilities relevant to Customs in the Australian Coastal Surveillance Centre, the number of aircraft is clearly very limited. The siting of the planes in northern Australia reflects the highly questionable assumption that smuggling activity will occur only in that zone. Practical experience teaches us that that is just not the case. If I might refer the House back to the tabling in this House of the Williams report, the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Hayden) noted that the report cited the case of a Taiwanese fishing boat sailing a considerable distance up the Brisbane River before it was detected. Apparently it had journeyed undetected from Darwin, using a school atlas. I well recall the classic remark of the Minister for Defence (Mr Killen) that the military capability of Australia was such that it could not defend Botany Bay on a sunny Sunday afternoon, but surely it is a ridiculous state of affairs when a flimsy Taiwanese fishing boat can sail around the coast of Australia and up the Brisbane River without anybody noticing it is there.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Williams report also found that, in the two years to August 1979, there were 109 unresolved sightings of unidentified aircraft flying into Australia. Some of these, the Commission said, could reasonably be expected to have carried narcotics. That is not a very profound statement, but I am sure it carries a deal of truth. Similarly, in the eight years to June 1978, there were 12 proven illegal importations of drugs by small seacraft, leading to action in the courts and various people being incarcerated. With such limited surveillance capacity, it is reasonable to say that no doubt these sightings and captures were just the tip of the iceberg. It is interesting to note some of the recommendations of the Williams Royal Commission in relation to surveillance. The first recommendation I mention appears on page B441, and it states:
       </para>
       <para>
        Surveillance of Australia's coastline should not be confined to Northern Australia.
       </para>
       <para>
        That is something with which the Opposition agrees. It should be noted at once that the Government's placement of the Customs planes breaches this recommendation. The Commission also recommended:
       </para>
       <para>
        The responsibility for three Nomad aircraft dedicated to coastal surveillance by the Bureau of Customs should be transferred to the Australian Coastal Surveillance Centre.
       </para>
       <para>
        We do not disagree with that recommendation either. Going further at page B383 the Commission noted that it was unable to ascertain with any precision the role of these three Customs aircraft. It noted in particular that the speed of the Nomad is very low. Some people say that someone on a hang-glider can almost rush past a Nomad. In fact, its speed is somewhere in the vicinity of 150 to 200 knots, while the only established case of an aircraft being used to drop narcotics in Australia involved an aircraft with a much higher speed capacity-in excess of 200 knots. We all know that that plane was detected because the damn thing crashed. No one caught it; it crashed quite by accident in Central Australia. The Department told the Royal Commission that the planes were response vehicles, 'response' being the operative word, and I would like the Minister to explain what response means. The Royal Commission was not convinced, and probably was not very amused either. I note that, in answer to a question in Estimates Commitee D on 29 August 1980, the Department again referred to these planes as response planes.
       </para>
       <para>
        There we have it. Firstly, planes are operated by an agency which the Royal Commission recommended should not operate them. Secondly, they operate in areas of Australia which the Royal Commission found should no longer be the focus of attention. Thirdly, they operate in roles which the Royal Commission could not ascertain. That is not a very splendid record of service and devotion, I might say to the Minister. Added to that, we now have a fourfold extension of the surveillance area, which clearly means that the capacity to provide surveillance with such minimal resources is totally inadequate.
       </para>
       <para>
        I suppose that this is what small government is all about. I hope that more and more Australians will realise that when the penny-pinching philosophy called small government really surfaces, it is an unabashed abdication of government responsibility. In this area of surveillance of our coastline as a means of keeping narcotics out of Australia and out of the reach of Australian kids, I am sure that the Minister shares my concern that the resources available to him are not adequate to do the job. In some other areas the Opposition welcomes the legislative improvements in respect of the role of Customs. We hope-I fear in vain-that the Government will match these improvements with an appropriate commitment of resources. I notice the Minister is smiling. I am sure that he agrees with me.
       </para>
       <para>
        I turn briefly now to the second group of amendments provided in the Bill. These clarify the powers and procedures of the Customs Bureau and, again, the Opposition has no objection to them. One of the more important provisions in this group is that which makes principals liable for the acts of employees involved in the unauthorised movement of goods in a Customs area. An adequate defence is provided by the Bill to protect principals who take reasonable precautions and exercise due diligence in respect of such goods. The Opposition contacted the Customs Agents Federation regarding these provisions because obviously they have an important effect on the members of that organisation. I am happy to report that the Federation has no objection to them, but it should be noted that that is just as well because there appears to have been no consultation between the Federation and the Government. It seems to me singularly appropriate that, where legislation affects business in various ways, there should be consultation, but that seems not to be this Government's philosophy. It is trying to reduce consultation, and apparently it made no effort at all in this case. That is probably a failing of this Government in many other areas. Where changes are made which affect industries, the people who work in them and the people who run them, consultation with those industries should be mandatory before the decisions are made. You, Sir, might well remember the singular victory you had in this House in the case of the wine brandy growers and the certain consultation that was lacking in that area. I suggest to the Minister that he should not neglect this important need. If he does talk to the Customs Agents Federation he will find that its members do have problems with clearing goods through Customs. He should look at ways of improving this situation. I am sure that he will not find that so-called small government is the answer in this case either.
       </para>
       <para>
        The third major series of amendments in this Bill relate to the powers of Customs to deal with illegally imported vessels, particularly refugee boats, which are condemned or otherwise unseaworthy. Problems arose with the Customs Act two or three years ago when several dozen refugee boats in Darwin Harbour presented a major disposal problem. I can well remember being in Darwin at that stage and seeing the harbour festooned with these odd craft which people had used to escape to Australia. Amending legislation passed last year with the support of the Opposition and these further provisions add to those new powers. Of course, the Opposition supports the provisions which give the Bureau of Customs the right to destroy those boats if necessary.
       </para>
       <para>
        Finally, the fourth major provision of the Bill is that to amend section 226 to extend the validity period of customs tariff proposals from six months to 12 months. The Excise Amendment Bill, which is also a subject of this cognate debate, similarly provides for an extension of the validity period for excise tariff proposals. Customs tariff and excise tariff proposals are of fundamental importance to the Australian economy. They have two fundamental roles. Firstly, they are taxes, and vitally important taxes at that. Many of the excise tariff proposals relate to the crude oil levy, which, of course, has been a massive tax slug for one thing, but which has also been a massive advantage to the Government in reducing the deficit. The Government has trumpeted loudly about its great efficiency in reducing the deficit. We of the Opposition and the Australian public know that the deficit has been reduced only by means of the levy which has come out of the pockets of the public. Total customs and excise taxation revenue estimated for the current year is $7,762m, nearly one-quarter of the Government's total tax revenue.
       </para>
       <para>
        The second fundamental role of customs and excise tariffs is the implementation of industry policy. Tariffs, of course, are the principal means whereby Australian industries are protected from import competition. The jobs of hundreds of thousands of Australians are at stake every time a customs tariff amendment Bill is passed by this House. We believe that legislation of such fundamental importance to the taxation and industry policies of Australia should not be tampered with lightly. However, the Government is proposing to halve the frequency with which the principal legislation enacting changes in tariff rates is to be dealt with and debated in this Parliament. Tariff and excise charges can already be implemented months in advance of parliamentary approval, but the Government wants to extend the period during which it can collect these taxes without legislative backing in the forms of customs or excise tariff amendments. The Opposition cannot agree to those provisions. We cannot accept that a government should reserve for itself an extended capacity to impose retrospective legislation to collect taxes while, at the same time, failing to act retrospectively against tax avoiders. This Government has been anything but backward in adopting a holier than thou attitude when it comes to retrospective legislation with regard to tax avoidance. However, here we find the Government cooly, coldly and blandly implementing this provision in this House to impose taxes retrospectively.
       </para>
       <para>
        We do not believe that the Parliament's role should be further downgraded in this way. We acknowledge, of course, that it is not possible to change tariffs by legislation enacted in advance of the date such changes come into effect, but there is no reason to extend beyond a full sitting of the Parliament the period before legislation is introduced. If income tax on government spending decisions were treated in such a cavalier fashion we would have a constitutional crisis. The Opposition will not agree to these changes dealing with one-quarter of the Government's revenue. In summary, the Opposition welcomes the improvements in customs administration provided by this Bill in such areas as the clearance of goods, surveillance against illegal imports and dealing with illegally imported vessels. However, we oppose the Government's attempts to reduce further the role of this Parliament in scrutinising and determining excise and tariff rates in Australia. To assist the passage of this Bill and to assist the Government to clear the backlog of legislation, we will be doing our best not to hinder the House too much. We intend to oppose clause 28 of the Customs Amendment Bill in the Committee stage. We intend to oppose the Excise Amendment Bill in its entirety at the second reading stage. We will divide on each occasion.

         â€”The purpose of these Bills is to bring the Australian anti-dumping law into conformity with the revised codes of conduct for international trade agreed to at the Tokyo round of the Multilateral Trade Negotiations. It will not be any surprise to the Government to find that the Opposition supports these measures because Australia's first venture into anti-dumping legislation occurred in the time of the illustrious Whitlam Government. So we are not about to oppose the Government's sticking to what we originally introduced. The Bills amend the Customs Tariff (Anti-Dumping) Act 1975 in accordance with the revised General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade code on anti-dumping, subsidies and countervailing measures. These two codes are among several considered at the Tokyo round in the context of non-tariff barriers to trade.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        One of the two principal objectives of the Tokyo round was to secure a series of multilateral agreements on the conduct of international trade. I think it is fair to say that the Tokyo round appears to have been successful in respect of its other main objective which was to achieve a substantial reduction in tariffs applying to industrial products. The first instalment of these tariff reductions took effect on 1 January 1980. The major industrial nations reduced tariffs on industrial products. Over the eight years to 1988, tariffs are to be reduced by about one-third. I can only applaud that as being a major breakthrough. This success on the tariff front has moved the centre of attention towards non-tariff barriers to trade. It is in this area that the success of the Tokyo round is less than certain.
       </para>
       <para>
        It should be recognised that reductions in non-tariff barriers to trade are of vital importance not only to Australia but also to the economy of the entire world. Growth in trade has normally been associated with the growth in national incomes, increased productivity and an increased standard of living. Provided trade is conducted on a fair basis, it will almost always prove mutually beneficial to its participants. In this context the maintenance of Australia's anti-dumping law in accordance with internationally agreed principles is firmly supported by the Opposition. The purpose of the anti-dumping law is to ensure that trade is conducted on a fair and efficient basis. It is not a back door method for controlling imports or for erecting barriers to trade. However, we must always be aware of the fact that indiscriminate use of anti-dumping provisions invites retaliation against our own exports. There have been instances in recent history of this occurring, not necessarily in Australia. At the same time, indiscriminate use limits the effectiveness of our anti-dumping investigations because it prejudices co-operation with our trading partners.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Opposition notes and welcomes the support expressed by a number of industry organisations for Australia's accession to the anti-dumping code. Of course, it is essential that this responsible attitude is taken if international agreement is to be maintained. I will refer later in my remarks to the subsidies and countervailing measures code to which Australia has not yet acceded. Overall, the new code probably makes it easier to prove a case of dumping against an exporter. The GATT code considers that a product is being dumped:
       </para>
       <para>
        . . . if the export price of the product exported from one country to another is less than the comparable price, in the ordinary course of trade, for the like product when destined for consumption in the exporting country.
       </para>
       <para>
        This is a very long-winded way of explaining the position. What is basically meant is that if country A wants to export to country B, then country B has the right to expect that the export price quoted by country A is in fact the price used for the sale of that commodity in country A. The code additionally requires that dumpings cause or threaten to cause injury before dumping action is appropriate to be undertaken. Clearly, the key concepts in the dumping law are export price, normal value and injury. It is the revised definition of these concepts which is at the heart of the new code and its amending legislation.
       </para>
       <para>
        Clause 3 introduces new provisions which draw a distinction between export prices arising from what is known as arms length transactions on the one hand and transactions where the importer and exporter are associated on the other hand. Where the importer and the exporter are associated and hence the stated export price may be higher than the export price which effectively prevails, appropriate adjustments may be made. This clause also covers the contingency where, for example, goods may be sent to Australia for sale on consignment and an agreed export price struck which may not be valid. This clause should assist in the administration of the code enabling the Minister to find anti-dumping action more easily warranted where transaction prices appear to be constructed to avoid anti-dumping action.
       </para>
       <para>
        Similarly, clause 4 strengthens the Minister's hand in relation to the assessment of normal value by inserting criteria which enable a fair assessment of normal value to be made in the home country. Obviously, this clause has been introduced to cover the case of countries that have centrally planned economies where it is difficult to establish what is, in fact, normal value.

Obviously, there would be anomolies in countries with centrally planned economies where goods may be subsidised by all sorts of government measures. Obviously, it would be difficult to establish what real, normal value is. I will raise a matter of particular concern that the Opposition has in this regard. Obviously, to ascertain the normal value of an exported product, it is necessary to conduct inquiries in the exporting country. It would re reasonable to suggest that an adequate staff be maintained in appropriate locations by the Department of Business and Consumer Affairs in order for this to happen.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The Bill before the House generally strengthens the provisions of the anti-dumping code. At the same time, the economic recession in Europe is likely to provoke some exporters to attempt to dump goods on the world market; obviously, that would include Australia. These two facts imply a need to take greater care and to devote more resources to anti-dumping administration. Yet it is my understanding that, as a part of the razor gang's determinations, the Australian Bureau of Customs staff in London, which also services continental Europe, is to be drastically reduced; in fact, I understand that the office is to be closed down altogether. I consider this another example of the stupidity of the 'small government' rhetoric of the Fraser Administration. Far from assisting the private sector we have here another example of harm to local companies which may face dumping from those countries where we may not have sufficient resources available to prove that dumping is in fact happening.
       </para>
       <para>
        I ask the Minister to indicate what is happening to the Customs administration in the anti-dumping area and to explain to the House how a stronger code is to be backed up without an appropriate increment in the staffing resources devoted to its administration. I know that the staff of the Australian Bureau of Customs is extremely efficient. I am sure that the officers sitting in the advisers seats no doubt would support me in this view. However, they are not supermen, no matter how much they might try and even though the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs (Mr Moore) might look like an affable Clark Kent, I am sure that his men cannot do the work required unless they have extra staff. I am particularly keen to learn what the future of the Hong Kong, Tokyo, Auckland and New York offices will be, given the apparent decision to close the London office.
       </para>
       <para>
        The administration of dumping law is of crucial importance, it if is to be at all effective. Recently there have been complaints of dumping by Japanese exporters of washing machines and by Korean exporters of steel. These complaints need to be dealt with quickly. If they are proven, action should be taken quickly. If they are not proven, that too should be quickly notified because trade should not be encumbered with false accusations and hostile attitudes. An efficient and speedy process which is as objective as possible is needed. In this light, I must raise the question of the Government's action in establishing a joint industry-government Dumping Evaluation Committee, in the case of the steel industry, and what that is likely to achieve.
       </para>
       <para>
        I have with me a media release from the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs which speaks of the creation of a joint iron and steel industry-departmental Dumping Evaluation Committee. The Minister decided to set up this committee to look at the proposition that Korean steel was being dumped in Australia at a cheap rate. The chief appellant, of course, was Broken Hill Proprietary Company Ltd. That poses some interesting questions. Apart from being Australia's steel manufacturing giant, the BHP company is also interested in the export of iron ore and coal, amongst other things. I suppose it must sometimes wonder whether its customers in other countries, particularly Korea, might be tempted to dump steel back to Australia. I guess there would be some manufacturers of white goods or other implements in Australia which might be concerned that the only steel they can buy in Australia is at a price which is largely set by BHP. I guess that some of those companies might well be interested in buying some Korean steel.
       </para>
       <para>
        So, when this anti-dumping action was promulgated, the Minister set up this committee. I wonder at the efficacy of that committee. I notice that the industry will be represented by Mr Cox, the Executive General Manager (Tube Division) of Tubemakers of Australia Limited, Mr H. R. Fowler, the General Manager of Australian Tube Mills Pty Ltd, Mr J. R. McGregor, the Chief Tariff Officer of Broken Hill Proprietary Company Ltd, and Mr G. A. White, the Secretary of John Lysaght (Australia) Ltd. It seems to me to be a peculiar state of affairs to have these people on a committee set up by the Government to investigate a complaint by BHP when they either work for BHP or for companies in which BHP has a very large interest. Whilst I am not doubting the honesty, sincerity or integrity of these gentlemen, I think any people who investigate themselves rarely come up with the right conclusion. I throw that in as an object of my interest, and perhaps the Minister might like to respond. I wonder whether it is a legitimate example of Government-industry co-operation or whether it is just another cog in the wheel without any clear function.

         â€”I am talking about industry representatives. I know that the committee will be chaired by Mr Willett, the First Assistant Secretary of the Industries Assistance Division of the Department of Business and Consumer Affairs, but I was merely referring to the business interests on that committee which all seem to have a fairly vested interest in deciding that Korean steel is being dumped here too cheaply. If the Minister had managed to put on that committee a few other people from manufacturing industry, they may have had a countervailing view. I would appreciate a statement on this issue that might shed more light on it than that media release of 8 April.

        I turn now to clause 5 of the Bill which amends the provisions in relation to injury. I am talking about injury in a financial sense, not in regard to BHP which has probably suffered an injury to its pride. Once again, the new provisions tend to strengthen the hand of those seeking anti-dumping action. The concept of injury is extended to include a threat of injury because the provisions also apply to the hindrance of the establishment of a new industry. The Opposition welcomes these provisions as they should enable more rapid action against dumping practices without extending unduly the scope of the law.
       </para>
       <para>
        The three clauses to which I have referred specifically in my remarks relate to the provisions of the Anti-Dumping Code. Other provisions in the Bill relate to the Subsidies and Countervailing Measures Code. These provisions are similar to the anti-dumping law in that they enable the Government to protect Australian industries from imports which are subsidised by foreign governments. As yet, Australia has not acceded to this code, apparently because its prohibition on export subsidies is likely to mean that our own Export Expansion Grants Scheme will be in conflict with the code. Perhaps the Minister might like to comment on that. The Opposition strongly supports the provision of export market development assistance in Australia but is very concerned at the very high cost of the Export Expansion Grants Scheme. I believe that a comprehensive view of export programs is urgently needed. The Government deserves to be strongly condemned for its ad hoc approach to this area.

         â€”I would not say that. I think some members opposite would support me if they were game to speak up but they are curtailed by party loyalties. Recently the razor gang extended the Export Expansion Grants Scheme for a further year at a reduced rate of payment. This decision is a classic example of opportunism. There appears to have been no assessment of the scheme in the proper framework of our approach to the GATT codes, and no indication whether the scheme is cost-effective. There has been no consideration whether the $26m spent on trade commissioner services and associated trade services would be better increased rather than spending $200m on hand-outs to successful exporters. I would like to know how an exporter who has managed to get an export industry going and is achieving profits from it but is then handed a financial bonus because of that, can be of advantage to Australia. This Government has responsibility to co-ordinate these programs, to assess them properly not in the context of windy rhetoric about small government but in the proper context of our trading policy and our industrial development policy.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        This Government exercises no such responsibility. It cuts vital services on the one hand yet thinks nothing of spending hundreds of millions of dollars on subsidies for private companies which it claims are in need of, to use its euphemistic phrase, room to grow. It does not know whether these subsidies come close to being effective in terms of their stated objectives or in relation to alternatives which involve much lower outlays. In the meantime, we hear nothing from the Government about its future policy in this vitally important area of trade relations. This is not a philosophy of small government; it is evidence of incompetent government and of a government hell-bent on taking from the poor and giving to the rich.
       </para>
       <para>
        After hearing the debates that have gone on in this Parliament in the last week or so about the Government's attempts to introduce what it describes as small government-attempts which I might say have been lauded by all sorts of industry groups such as the Confederation of Australian Industry, chambers of manufacture and particularly rural groups-it seems to me quite strange that there has been no suggestion that hand-outs to industry should be curtailed in any way. I do not hear these industry groups suggesting that the investment allowance, the accelerated depreciation allowance or export development grants should be reduced. The only thing that they have been crying for in terms of small government is a reduction in the services required by the poor of this country. I find that rather deplorable. In summary, the Opposition indicates that it will support these Bills, notwithstanding the damage to their administration which the Government has caused and the many unanswered questions regarding trade policy which a consideration of these Bills suggests to us. I hope that my remarks may provoke some reply from the Minister on some of these questions.

         â€”I think I heard the honourable member for Parramatta (Mr John Brown) ask at the beginning of his speech how the Opposition could oppose the amendments to the Customs Tariff (Anti-Dumping) Bill because, after all, it was the Whitlam Government which introduced anti-dumping measures in 1975. Certainly the legislation that the House is amending tonight was introduced by the Whitlam Government in 1975 but I can remember distinctly in 1973 when the Whitlam Government first came to power that the then Minister for Customs and Excise, Senator Murphy, by unilateral action took off anti-dumping duties against European cheese which had been proven to have been dumped in Australia by the then provisions of anti-dumping codes at an earlier time. I am a little puzzled by that statement, although I am never amazed at the actions of some Labor Ministers.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The honourable member for Parramatta commented that generally these amendments are to update the code that was last legislated in 1975. They take into account what has been agreed to under the provisions of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade during the Tokyo round of the Multilateral Trade Negotiations. Generally that is a good thing. To me the amendments overcome some, but not all, of the deficiencies which have been shown in succeeding years since 1975. I will refer to those a little later. Some examples of the changes and updating in this legislation are: The new power whereby retrospective duties may be imposed in cases where undertakings previously given are violated; the provision for the Minister to assess amounts of subsidies in cases of goods exported from countries where governments substantially influence prices; and the criteria set out for determining the price level, whether it is the domestic price, export price, third country price or Australian price.
       </para>
       <para>
        We have seen a recent example of the difficulty in establishing a normal selling price for a product from a country with a socialist economy. Canned ham from Romania and Yugoslavia was imported to Australia. There was difficulty in establishing a normal selling price for that product. Another provision of this Bill is that, where undertakings have been violated, retrospective countervailing duties may be imposed. The Bill also allows for the imposition of retrospective countervailing duties when massive quantities of subsidised imports over a short period have caused injury. I support all these provisions, particularly the last one. I remember very well the situation in 1973 and 1974 when massive imports of ball-bearings from Taiwan circumvented the voluntary agreement reached between the governments of Australia and Japan. The export of ball-bearings from Japan had been reduced because of the harm it was causing the ball-bearing industry then in Australia. Of course, there is no longer a ball-bearing industry as such in Australia. The major and only complete manufacturer, the ball-bearing factory at Echuca, eventually closed down. A good percentage of the companies which operate in Japan also operate in Taiwan. Those companies managed to do very nicely by circumventing the voluntary arrangement. If my memory is correct, there was no ability at that time to impose the retrospective duties which this Bill seeks to provide.
       </para>
       <para>
        The honourable member for Parramatta referred to clause 6 of the Bill which varies some of the definitions and criteria for the imposition of duty. He referred to the fact that now injury does not only have to be shown to be caused before duties are imposed but also it may be threatened. I think this is a very good insertion. We have seen many examples when the threat of a particular product entering Australia has had the same effect as would have been caused by the product actually getting here. I am worried by sub-clause (b) of clause 6. The word 'material' is to be inserted before the word 'injury'. That appears to me to be going the opposite way. I would be very interested to hear the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs (Mr Moore) explain how material injury differs from injury and how this sub-clause is to be interpreted. I am a little worried that it may be interpreted in a negative way.
       </para>
       <para>
        I refer to two basic weaknesses that are still apparent to me in the protective measures we are taking against unfair trading competition with Australian manufacturers or producers. The first concerns the special agreements we have with a number of countries, of which New Zealand is the principal, whereby the ordinary anti-dumping duties do not immediately apply. Paragraph 10 of the New Zealand-Australia Free Trade Agreement provides a 60-day consultation period. Recently, the report of the Industries Assistance Commission inquiry into cheese was finally tabled. It was presented to the Government by the IAC, I think, in March 1979. Agreement was reached between Australia and New Zealand about 12 months later. The 60-day period was extended to almost 12 months before agreement was reached on a product in respect of which dumping had been proved. This is not good enough.
       </para>
       <para>
        There is too much leeway for a country or an industry to make use of this more flexible approach for its own advantage. New Zealand certainly did so on that occasion. There were dra- matic increases in the amounts of cheese coming into Australia. At the end of the 12-month period, which should have been only 60 days, New Zealand was able to use the higher base of its cheese exports to Australia for the new arrangement which is now in place. I hope that if we reach some new agreement with New Zealand on closer economic relations or an expanded NAFTA, the New Zealanders will not be allowed to get away with what they have got away with under special provisions when dumping has been proved. I assure honourable members that the New Zealanders do not allow that to happen in return. They have special licensing and other provisions to protect their industries.
       </para>
       <para>
        I draw the attention of the Minister to another weakness in the Bill, that is, the ability for a producer-primary producers are the main example-to suffer the dumping of a product but be unable to appeal, apply for or be the cause of anti-dumping action to be taken because the processed product is being imported into this country. The producers of such products are suffering but because the products are being imported in processed forms they cannot make application. The processor has to make such application. As the Minister knows, the importation of sweet corn is a very good example of that problem. I hope he can give some assurance that the sourness that has been caused by the importation of sweet corn will be eliminated and that the situation will again be sweet. This problem relates particularly to New Zealand. It indicates the inflexibility in the determination of who can make an application. In this case the sweet corn producer is affected. On my understanding, some of the processors of sweet corn have a foot on both sides of the Tasman. It suits them not to make application for protection from what is clearly a dumped product. I hope that that weakness in the code of fair trade to protect Australian industry will be remedied in the very near future. I support the legislation.

         â€”Before I commence my contribution to this debate I refer to one of the comments made by the honourable member for Murray (Mr Lloyd). I have a supermarket advertisement which appeared in the New Zealand Evening Post on 6 January 1981. It indicates that a 450-gram can of sweet corn was selling in New Zealand at that time for 55c. The same brand was selling in Australia for 37c. That is evidence of what the honourable member for Murray was saying. There is a gap which needs to be remedied.

        As my colleague the honourable member for Parramatta (Mr John Brown) indicated, we on this side of the House will not oppose the Customs Tariff (Anti-Dumping) Amendment Bill or the Customs Amendment (Securities) Bill. I will concentrate on the Customs Tariff (Anti-Dumping) Amendment Bill. Under this legislation there is an obligation upon us to do two things. The first is to bring our own anti-dumping legislation into line with the anti-dumping code of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. It must be recalled that it was the Australian Labor Government which in 1975 brought down the comprehensive legislation that updated our anti-dumping legislation in line with the then existing GATT Anti-Dumping Code. Therefore, there is no reason in principle for us to oppose this Bill.
       </para>
       <para>
        Given that Australia must be a trading partner of a great number of nations, the necessity for orderly marketing practices ought to be only too evident. As the trading parties are off-shore to Australia and, therefore, are not normally subject to the local laws governing their trading behaviour, it has been recognised for years that internationally binding rules are required if orderly and equitable trading relations are to obtain. That point needs to be made clear about the nature of this legislation. We are talking about fair and equitable trading relations. That could not happen unless all parties to GATT brought the anti-dumping legislation into line with the Code to which they were signatories. Obligations to do so were imposed upon all signatories to the GATT Code. As has been said, the practice of dumping is reprehensible. Whilst in the short term consumers in an importing country might benefit from dumping practices, the long term continuation of such practices will no doubt be to their disadvantage. The short term increase in the choice of goods and lower prices will be offset by the disruptive effects upon the economy of the victim country. In all cases, the competing domestic producers will be forced to reduce their prices and employment opportunities or accept lower profits.
       </para>
       <para>
        Secondly, we ought to put this legislation through to ensure that Australian industries are given adequate protection from the dumping practices of either predatory trading nations or less scrupulous foreign business houses. Some of the business houses alluded to by the honourable member for Murray, who has disappeared from the chamber, are business houses that have a foot in both camps as it were and, therefore, are quite happy to see the situation continue because they are able to do the dumping under the lap. In principle, those members of the Government who have recently inveighed against industry protection in favour of free trade must feel rather uncomfortable with this piece of legislation. It must be stated that there is nothing intrinsically evil in government interference in the trade from one country to another. Some members of the Government would like to propagate the view that there is some evil in government oversight of industry. Without such oversight, as my colleague the honourable member for Parramatta has indicated, trading relations would become chaotic. I hope that as yet the Government has not entirely succumbed to the influence of the free traders. For example, we reject as unfair the practice of dumping and believe that we require international agreement, such as the GATT code, to enable us to police this practice. If all things were equal it might have been possible to have free trade, but the great differences that exist between ourselves and our trading partners in so many ways will make free trade a disaster for Australian industry and, as a consequence, the welfare of Australian markets, workers and families.
       </para>
       <para>
        As we know, dumping occurs when goods are exported at a price that is less than the normal value in the country of export. The normal value is generally defined as the price of like goods sold for home consumption in the exporting country in arm's length transactions by the exporter. The definition I have just quoted to the House enables us to establish a legal bar to more obvious injurious trading practices. Our international obligations require us to agree to legislate accordingly. It is for this reason that we of the Opposition support this legislation. However, as in most areas of human relationships, there is a tendency in some instances for exceptions to rules to intrude. This is a typical area. There are some practices which, whilst not necessarily fulfilling all the criteria for being called dumping, nevertheless need to be brought to the attention of the House because they do impose hardships upon sections of Australian industry. Again, the honourable member for Murray alluded to those. The differences between them and dumping are of degree only. I refer, of course, to imports of certain goods from New Zealand.
       </para>
       <para>
        The House would be aware that in recent days the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade and Resources (Mr Anthony) has been meeting with the New Zealand Prime Minister, Mr Muldoon, to negotiate a closer economic relations agreement between the two countries. Generally the relations between our two countries have been cordial throughout our history. It is to be hoped that this relationship will continue. However, I am unable to see how this will continue without some strain if the current negotiations result in opening the access to Australian markets of New Zealand products that will undercut the Australian equivalents. Strictly speaking, this does not fulfil all the criteria for a trading practice to be termed dumping, but the combination of factors will nevertheless result in the destruction of a number of very important primary industries in this country. Two major industries are of concern to me. I refer firstly to the potato industry and then, of course, to the fat lamb industry. Both of these industries affect the livelihood of many specialist farmers in my electorate of Ballarat.

         â€”It is rather unfortunate that the honourable member for Cowper knows so little about the concerns of people such as those of Ballarat. At the moment, if no cognisance is to be taken of the particular circumstances of the potato industry, for example, imports of potatoes from New Zealand would undercut the price of Australian potatoes to such an extent that the industry would be crippled. Under Australian dumping law, dumping could be said to occur when injury caused by a trading practice is seen to cause material injury and it must be demonstrated to be so. For example, losses of sales, depressed prices or retrenchments must be due principally to imports at non-competitive prices, and the injury must be demonstrated by the major proportion of local industry.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        Given the above, it is impossible for the injury not to occur should potatoes be fully able to be imported from New Zealand. Why is this so? Firstly, the real cost structure of each country is very different. The contract price of potatoes grown in New Zealand is the equivalent of $A42 per tonne. In Australia the contract price is $97.60 per tonne. The lower price of New Zealand potatoes is assisted by lower wage structures and government incentives. Secondly, the variations in currency values give the advantage to New Zealand potato growers. The depressed value of the New Zealand dollar makes it worth approximately 77c in Australian currency. The Australian dollar is a more buoyant currency and, therefore, movement tends to disadvantage Australian producers even more. Thirdly, the issue of government subsidies to potato producers further widens the gap between the possible price of potatoes imported into Australia from New Zealand and the minimum price Australian producers could obtain for their produce before suffering economic injury.
       </para>
       <para>
        In the Ballarat potato growing region alone, the loss of such an industry would place an excessive burden upon the capacity of local industries to survive. The potato growing industry will not be the only one to suffer. There are over 300 producers throughout this area and approximately 1,200 people are directly involved in one way or another in the industry. In a direct sense, the industry is worth to that area approximately $14m, and it stimulates a further $15m in local business. I am sure that I do not have to convince you, Mr Deputy Speaker, of the hardship that a policy of quasi dumping would have upon local potato producers. It should not be without interest to the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser), in his capacity as the honourable member for Wannon, that there are many potato producers in his electorate who would also be so affected. It is very important for points such as these to be made. As I have said, the practices might not be in direct contravention of the anti-dumping law but the effects are the same. Perhaps it is because of the inadequacies of the anti-dumping law that we have.
       </para>
       <para>
        Any dumping or quasi-dumping practices must have serious effects upon Australian producers whether they be primary producers such as potato growers or fat lamb producers, vegetable growers, processors, or the clothing, textile, footwear and engineering industries all of which are particularly vulnerable in this country. It is very important for the House to recognise that individuals, their families and the viability of towns and cities are endangered by dumping and quasi-dumping practices. Mr Deputy Speaker, I assure you that the economy of a city such as Ballarat would be rocked should the potato industry collapse as a result of the importing of potatoes produced in an economic climate different from that of Australia. Potato harvesting and packing machinery would be made redundant and so would the industries that produce that machinery. We cannot allow that sort of thing to happen. I do not have to remind the House that the multiplier effect would mean a reduction in the work force in the retail industry of rural and provincial towns. I hope that members on the National Country Party benches-for want of a more appropriate name-would show some concern about this issue. I highlight the effects of a quasi-dumping practice to bring some notes of caution to those people hell bent on liberalising our marketing arrangements and also because dumping practices in general have all these effects which are evil.

         â€”in reply-I wish to repond briefly to those honourable members who have taken part in the debate and to thank them for the effort that they have put into their speeches and the contributions that they have made. I am always surprised at the depth of knowledge of the honourable member for Parramatta (Mr John Brown). His wide ramble into dumping was quite an illuminating discussion even if one or two of the facts were not quite right. But that is not too bad when we relate it to some of these things. I wish to take issue with him on one point. The great era of dumping did not arrive with E. G. Whitlam at all. In fact, if one looks at the history of events it started when Australia removed import licencing in the 1960s. As a consequence certain dumping cases were taken and the procedures that are in place today eventually grew from that. The Government has every intention of maintaining these established positions. Commerce needs to know that we will be looking to its interests in every respect. That applies under the staffing situation where adequate provisions certainly will be made in some form to ensure that the dumping provisions are carried out in the best interests of Australian commerce. The anti-dumping committee to which the honourable member for Parramatta referred was established in the steel industry-its membership reflects this-to give a fast track response to dumping in that area. Those honourable members who take some interest in the iron and steel industry and the demand and supply situation will be aware of the high characteristics of fluctuation, to say the least, that occur and the need for prompt action. This committee consists of one member from the Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd, one member from a BHP subsidiary, one member from an entirely independent company which has no connection with BHP, and one member from my Department. They are there to establish a prima facie case. Once that has been established they do not recommend in any way or make any determination in relation to dumping. They purely make a quick response and it then goes to the appropriate authorities to make their determinations. The Department made an effort to assist in this area which was subject to some very quick changes in overseas supply and marketing of iron and steel in particular in the new developing nations. The honourable member for Murray (Mr Lloyd) as usual made--

In response to the honourable member for Ballarat (Mr Mildren) it is worth while saying that the provisions for trade with New Zealand are really not subject to the multilateral trade negotiations but are subject to the New Zealand-Australia Free Trade Agreement. Therefore, different provisions apply in relation to NAFTA products than do to the general dumping in other areas.

If, as it is inevitable, closer associations with New Zealand take place, one would hope that the negotiations between New Zealand and Australia would materialise at a very high officer level and a very high political level. That requires good will on both sides. Most honourable members have said that sometimes they feel there is good will in Australia but not necessarily in New Zealand.

Also, last year the Commonwealth joined with the Victorian Government in the establishment of a Royal Commission of Inquiry into the Federated Ships Painters and Dockers Union in relation to the activities of crime syndicates on the wharves. Finally, the Government intends, in conjunction with the Governments of the States of New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland, to establish in the near future a judicial inquiry with the powers of a Royal Commission, to investigate and report upon the activities of the Clark drug syndicate in Australia.

        â€”The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       (1) Both RAAF B707 aircraft undergo normal scheduled servicings during any twelve month period which include a periodic servicing (annual), a Check 3 servicing (three monthly), an A servicing (monthly) and before-flight/after-flight servicings as required. In respect of modifications to the two aircraft, I refer the honourable member to my answer to Parliamentary Question No. 5604, which appeared in Hansard on 18 September 1980 (page 1612). I am further advised that the on-board cargo handling system was delivered in early January 1981 and will be in service by May 1981. Additionally, auxiliary power units are being acquired, at an estimated cost of $1.32m, for fitment to the two RAAF Boeing 707 aircraft in June 1981, to meet a Defence operational requirement.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) The RAAF does not compile individual cost records of servicing carried out by its own personnel. Based on recent servicings performed by QANTAS the overall cost of services is as follows:
      </para>
      <para>
       Check 3 Service-$29,560
      </para>
      <para>
       Periodic Service-$408,920
      </para>
      <para>
       The annual cost for each aircraft for QANTAS servicings is therefore estimated as $527,160. However, variations to individual servicing costs do occur depending on the actual work content of each servicing.
      </para>
      <para>
       (3) There is currently no plan to re-carpet the RAAF B707 aircraft. However, the aircraft are re-carpeted as necessary to meet normal RAAF servicing standards, i.e. carpets are replaced as dictated by wear and tear. In the VIP configuration the B707 aircraft has two divans. The two divans supplied by QANTAS with their VIP fit have been demonstrated to be extremely uncomfortable on long distance flights and were difficult to remove and replace. Therefore RAAF (No. 486 Squadron) has manufactured two replacement divans which can also be used as fold-out beds. The estimated cost of materials is $120 for each divan. The new divans are fitted to the B707 aircraft in the same position as the old divans and are the same overall length.

       On 15 December 1980 I announced that the Government had approved the production of a further 55 Nomad aircraft, bringing the total number of aircraft authorised to date to 200.
      </para>
      <para>

      <para>
       Nomads are being used in regular passenger transport and charter operations, in various Military Command, Communication and Support Roles, in Coastal Surveillance, in Aerial Medical Roles including Flying Doctor Service, in Aerial Survey, in Geophysical Search, in Float-Plane Operations, in General Utility and Cargo Carrying Roles.

       Concerning the specific matters raised by the honorable member, I am advised that:
      </para>
      <para>
       (1) A number of factors have contributed to the slowing down of the Nomad production rate during 1980 and 1981; these include:
      </para>
      <para>
       (a) the unexpectedly longer lead-times for basic materials, parts and equipments from overseas suppliers due to the pressures of a buoyant overseas market for aircraft, have resulted in a shortage of supply to the production line;
      </para>
      <para>
       (b) the need for the urgent incorporation of aircraft modifications to improve the service life and acceptability of the aircraft; and
      </para>
      <para>
       (c) difficulties in the incorporation of special equipments for aircraft for the USA market which involved both local production and purchase of items from the USA which are hard to obtain.
      </para>
      <para>
       The situation was further compounded during 1980 by industrial unrest, including a month-long strike at the Government Aircraft Factories in March 1980 which had disruptive effects on production extending well beyond the period of the strike itself.

       (1) My attention was drawn to the editorial 'The Kangaroo from the veldt' in the Australian Financial Review of 19 February 1981 and I wrote a letter to the editor which was published in the Australian Financial Review on 24 February 1981.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) The Ashton joint venture comprises CRA Ltd 56.76 per cent, Ashton Mining Ltd 38.24 per cent and Northern Mining Corp NL 5 per cent. Major foreign interests hold 61.1 per cent of CRA and 60.35 per cent of Ashton Mining. Accordingly, foreign equity in the Ashton joint venture is at present 57.8 per cent. However, under the Government's naturalisation provisions of its foreign investment policy, undertakings have been given by the parties concerned that Australian ownership in CRA and Ashton Mining will be increased to 51 per cent. As a consequence, foreign equity in the Ashton joint venture will be reduced to 48.4 per cent.
      </para>
      <para>
       (3) As the Ashton joint venture project is to be developed by two naturalising companies and an Australian company, the parties are not required to notify the Foreign Investment Review Board of proposals for development of the venture. Accordingly, there are no conditions including matters such as Aboriginal consultations and environment protection attaching to the project at this stage. However, arrangements for the marketing of product from the project could affect the equity and control arrangement for the joint venture and will be examined by the Government in terms of its foreign investment policy prior to the project proceeding to development.
      </para>
      <para>
       (4) The Government does not specify a firm time limit for a naturalising company to meet its obligations to increase Australian equity to the required level of 51 per cent. The Government expects this level to be achieved over the shortest period consistent with sound company management.
      </para>
      <para>
       (5) Discussions between the Foreign Investment Review Board and Ashton Mining and its major foreign shareholders will be held annually.
      </para>
      <para>
       (6). No. The Government saw no reason why it should treat Ashton Mining differently, on the ground that it has a connection with a Malaysian Government agency, from other companies seeking naturalisation. To have done so would have involved discrimination against a company which in all respects complied with the relevant terms of the naturalisation provisions. It is the Government's objective that a naturalised or naturalising company should operate with a predominantly Australian board and should be controlled by that board. Ashton Mining was able to satisfy the Government on all aspects of these requirements.

        â€”The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       (1) Criteria used in determining whether Commonwealth funds should be provided through the Aerodrome Local Ownership Plan (ALOP) are that the works to be carried out are approved as being necessary for the basic functioning of the aerodrome to meet the foreseeable demands of civil aviation.
      </para>
      <para>
       Grants are made available to local authorities, mission stations and other bodies accepted as performing the functions of local government. Privately owned licensed aerodromes may be eligible for Commonwealth assistance through the ALOP for approved maintenance projects if the aerodromes are served by regular public transport services.
      </para>
      <para>
       The criteria applied in determining whether Commonwealth funds should be provided are:
      </para>
      <para>
       the work is necessary for the safe operation of efficient and effective air services and that the need for these services can be adequately demonstrated
      </para>
      <para>
       in the case of remote communities, funds can also be made available to ensure a reasonable level of transport and communication and provide for essential services such as medical flights
      </para>
      <para>
       where a local authority takes over ownership of a Commonwealth aerodrome, funds are provided for the whole cost of bringing the aerodrome movement area to full standard for current and known future aviation commitment.

       (3) Following a submission by my Department to the Cairns City Council and Mulgrave Shire Council in February 1979 the question of local ownership was examined in detail by the Cairns Airport Development Committee. Negotiations culminated in an offer by the Government to provide grants of up to $16m for upgrading of airport facilities associated with the transfer of the airport to local ownership.
      </para>
      <para>
       Local authorities are seeking transfer of ownership of the airport to a State Statutory Body. The State Government is currently reviewing the impact of the ALOP in Queensland and discussions by State and Local Governments, including legislation enabling a State Statutory Body to own the aerodrome are awaited. I look forward to a successful conclusion to the negotiations as soon as possible.

        â€”The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       (1) Yes. Nitinol is an alloy of nickel and titanium. It has the interesting property that it is a 'shape memory' alloy-that is, when plastically deformed at one temperature, it will, on being heated above a specific temperature, regain its initial shape. In scientific terms this phenomenon is known as a thermo-elastic marternsitic transformation. Other alloys, including those of copper, zinc, and aluminium, display shape memory effects similar to Nitinol. However, they are much cheaper than Nitinol, are much easier to machine and fabricate and therefore find much greater use industrially. Nitinol provides a very good example of the shape memory phenomenon and is widely used in research into this phenomenon. Its high relative cost, and disadvantages vis-a-vis other alloys have meant that its industrial usage remains insignificant.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) Research work on Nitinol is conducted in a number of countries, including those listed. Intermittent research on shape memory alloys has been conducted in Australia over the past 20 years. None of the Australian work has been directed explicitly towards the use of Nitinol in solid state heat engines.
      </para>
      <para>
       (3) I am aware of this publication and would be happy to provide a copy to the honourable member if he so desires.
      </para>
      <para>
       (4) Research work on Nitinol and related alloys is being conducted in Australia in the Department of Metallurgy of the University of Wollongong, under the direction of Associate Professor N. F. Kennon. This work has been supported, in part, by grants from the ARGC ($9,000 in 1981, and $8,000 in 1980). The Australian research on Nitinol, and shape memory alloys in general, is consistent with the scale of the total Australian research effort seen in a world context. More importantly, the priorities of the Australian research community reflect its perceptions of the solubility and fruitfulness of the various research areas.
      </para>
      <para>
       As noted in (2) above, no research is being conducted in Australia on the use of Nitinol in heat engines although CSIRO maintains a 'watching brief' on overseas developments.
      </para>
      <para>
       (5) Technological developments which would utilize Australia's large reserves of nickel and titanium would be of significant value. However, as noted above, the current industrial use of Nitinol is negligible and it is unlikely that applications for Nitinol will be developed in the foreseeable future. An urgent examination of the significance of Nitinol could not be justified.

       The Superannuation Fund Investment Trust is an independent corporate body established under the Superannuation Act 1976. As such, the Trust has sole responsibility under the Act for the management and investment of the Superannuation Fund, being required only to report annually on the management of the Fund to the Parliament through the Minister for Finance. The Chairman of the Trust has, however, provided the following answers to the honourable member's questions (1) to (6):
      </para>
      <para>
       (1) Yes.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) Yes.
      </para>
      <para>
       (3) (a) Both the accountants and actuaries were engaged on the basis of their expertise in the particular area on which the advice was being sought.
      </para>
      <para>
       (b) The Trust.
      </para>
      <para>
       (c) The ACOA Federal Executive was made aware of the commissioning of the firms of accountants and actuaries in replies to correspondence on the subject received by the then Minister for Finance from the office of the late Senator Knight on 8 July 1980 and 18 August 1980.
      </para>
      <para>
       (4) The firm of accountants has carried out audit and accounting advice work on behalf of the Trust since 1976.
      </para>
      <para>
       The firm of actuaries has not previously carried out any work on behalf of the Trust.
      </para>
      <para>
       Other than that mentioned in the foregoing, no member of the Trust has had dealings with these consultants in the past through private or other interests.
      </para>
      <para>
       (5) The Trust is currently considering the report from the firm of accountants and the report from the firm of actuaries is expected shortly. It is a matter for the Trust, in the first instance, to complete its examination of the reports and to submit recommendations to the Minister on any changes to the accounting arrangements that it considers are warranted. When both reports are to hand, the Trust will give consideration to seeking the views of staff organisations on the issues addressed in the consultants' reports.
      </para>
      <para>
       (6) The Commissioner of Taxation oversights the practices followed by non-government superannuation schemes to ensure that the levels of benefits provided are not excessive and that appropriate contributions are made. To this end, I understand the Commissioner has regard among other things, to the value of any investment assets owned by a superannuation fund but the basis of valuation of these assets would depend upon individual circumstances. Although the Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme is not subject to the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936, the formulation and operation of the Scheme, including the operations of the Trust, broadly follows the principles applicable to private sector schemes. Consistent with this, I understand that the Trust will have regard to private sector practice when making its recommendations.

Canada also has introduced a code of conduct which likewise is exhortatory and not mandatory in character.

The Australian Embassy in Washington has been asked to pursue the question.

       The demand for all telecommunication services in Queensland is extremely high and increasing annually. Similarly, new telephone service connections have been increased from an annual connection rate in 1977-78 of 61,167 to the current year connection which will exceed 97,000.

       (1) Further to his answer to my question without notice on 25 March 1981 (Hansard, page 882), is he able to say when the New Zealand authorities first were alerted to the outbreak of suspected exotic animal disease near Timaru which subsequently led to investigation and declaration of an infected place on 11 February 1981.

       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       (1) A Ministry of Agriculture Veterinary Officer first suspected that a vesicular disease was implicated on the morning of 11 February 1981. He called in a second Veterinary Officer from the New Zealand Ministry later that morning. The conclusion was reached on the afternoon of 11 February that a vesicular disease was implicated. This led to the declaration of the property as an infected place at 4.30 p.m. New Zealand time on the same day.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) No. The New Zealand Government decided that foreign authorities should be notified at the same time as the Prime Ministerial announcement was made to the New Zealand people (viz. 9.30 a.m. on 12 February). The matter has been discussed with the New Zealand authorities and a Senior Veterinary Officer will visit New Zealand early in May for further discussions.
      </para>
      <para>
       (3) Australia and New Zealand are members of the Office Internationale des Epizooties (located in Paris), the rules of which require notification of exotic diseases within 24 hours of confirmation. (This disease was never confirmed). In addition to this, an Australia/New Zealand Technical Committee on Quarantine was set up in 1966 and regular communication on quarantine matters is exchanged by annual meetings of this group. Between meetings, information is exchanged on a direct basis and may involve any of the following matters: changes in vaccination or in importation policies and, in particular, outbreaks of disease. These arrangements are on the basis of bilateral notification 'as soon as possible'.
      </para>
      <para>
       (4) Yes. Arrangements for notification exist. See 3 above. I am advised that arrangements were made for a telex to be sent to Australia to coincide with the New Zealand Prime Minister's announcement at 9.30 a.m. on 12 February New Zealand time. I understand that the telex left the New Zealand Ministry immediately after the public announcement but, in accordance with normal New Zealand diplomatic procedure, was forwarded via the NZ High Commission in Canberra. The telex did not reach the Australian Quarantine Service until 1.45 p.m. Australian time by which time the news had been received through the media.
      </para>
      <para>
       (5) My officers received the first reports through the media at 10.30 a.m. on 12 February Australian time. The Quarantine Division immediately established that the Department of Primary Industry had heard simultaneously of the incident via a call from Paris where the Office Internationale des Epizooties was, by chance, meeting. The call indicated that an incident had been reported in New Zealand. At 10.40 a.m., a call was placed by the Quarantine Division to the New Zealand authorities to seek confirmation. Connection was not achieved until approximately 11.15 a.m. While awaiting connection the implementation of additional quarantine precautions, was planned in case they proved to be necessary. When connection was achieved the New Zealand authorities confirmed a suspected vesicular disease outbreak and, at the same time, were advised, broadly, of precautionary measures that Australia would take.
      </para>
      <para>
       (6) Additional precautionary measures were in place at Mascot by 11.50 a.m. (i.e. 20 minutes after completion of the call to New Zealand) and in all Australian airports by 12.30 p.m. No alert was sent to airports or any additional check of New Zealand planes implemented after the 10.30 a.m. media reports. Rather, immediate confirmatory action as outlined in (5) was taken. As indicated there, the time between placing the call to New Zealand and connection (viz 10.40 a.m. to 11.15 a.m.) was utilised to plan additional quarantine measures which may have been necessary. There was of course no way of knowing how quickly the connection to New Zealand would be made. It would have been totally irresponsible to implement restrictions before confirmation of the outbreak had been received from the source.

      <para>
       Normal quarantine procedures will apply to all United States Air Force B52 aircraft arriving at Darwin, Northern Territory.
      </para>
      <para>
       The usual quarantine measures are as follows: On arrival the aircraft is boarded by a Quarantine Officer and his assistants. The General Declaration prepared in advance by the captain of the aircraft is sighted and a visual examination made of the persons on board. The quarantine assistants disinsect both the aircraft cabin and holds. Vaccination certificates and other travel documents are examined for compliance with Australia's entry requirements.
      </para>
      <para>
       When the Quarantine Officer is satisfied that the aircraft and all on board are not a source of infection, a certificate of pratique is granted. Until this time no goods (including refuse and unconsumed foodstuffs) can be landed and no persons are allowed to board the aircraft.
      </para>
      <para>
       Following the granting of pratique refuse and unconsumed foodstuffs may be removed from the aircraft under quarantine supervision. Items of quarantine concern are not to be removed without the permission of the Quarantine Officer.

        asked the Minister representing the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, upon notice, on 2 April 1981:
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       (1) Has the Minister's attention been drawn to the state of the operating theatres at the Repatriation General Hospital, Daw Park, South Australia, which were built in 1942 but which have not been upgraded since.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) Does the small size of these theatres provide a number of serious problems, such as (a) increasing the potential for infection because it is difficult to prevent sterile drapes on the trays from being touched by staff who have to move in and out of the operating room and (b) necessitating the operating table to be placed diagonally across the room in certain major surgical procedures to allow X-ray machinery to be brought in.
      </para>
      <para>
       (3) Are there too few theatres at the hospital which means that (a) they cannot be left to 'breathe' while being effectively cleaned between cases, (b) it is not possible to reserve at least one theatre for certain particular 'clean' cases and (c) it is frequently necessary for surgery to be performed on 'clean' cases straight after 'dirty' cases such as open bowel surgery thereby greatly increasing the likelihood of infection.
      </para>
      <para>
       (4) Is the endoscopy room at the hospital where minor procedures are performed, often used for procedures for which it is not equipped, such as cardiac pacemaker insertion.
      </para>
      <para>
       (5) Is the airconditioning in this room sub-standard, and does it result in the problems of (a) accumulation of dust and bacteria which cause particular concern in eye and ear surgery and (b) the likelihood that operating rooms are either too hot or too cold placing patients under anaesthesia at great risk from such temperature extremes.
      </para>
      <para>
       (6) Are the floors of the operating theatres also sub-standard, and in particular, does the repeated lifting of the floor coverings and the pooling of water in certain areas create a situation encouraging the growth of bacteria.
      </para>
      <para>
       (7) Have there been recent problems with the isolation of pathogenic organisms and are the measures taken only temporarily effective.
      </para>
      <para>
       (8) Is there a hazardous communicating passage between the 2 main theatres which leads to the carriage of infection between theatres and cross-contamination.
      </para>
      <para>
       (9) Is the recovery room far too small, being equipped for 4 patients but often having to cope with 7, so that patients have had to be left in the main corridor because no space has been available in the recovery room.
      </para>
      <para>
       (10) Are there suitable areas for anaesthetising patients at the hospital; if not, do patients requiring local anaesthetics usually have these administered in the recovery room, next to patients who may be vomiting, coughing, et cetera thereby adding to the anxiety of the patients awaiting treatment, and are other patients undesirably exposed to the flurry and fright of being wheeled conscious into the operating theatre, against modern standards of surgical practice.
      </para>
      <para>
       (11) Is some equipment at the hospital stored in corridors because the storage area is too small; if so, has some of this equipment been damaged because of this situation.
      </para>
      <para>
       (12) Are surgical instruments crowded into cupboards which are totally inadequate for this purpose; if so, are there difficulties in maintenance and in the selection of particular items when they are suddenly and urgently required.
      </para>
      <para>
       (13) Is there any area where out-patients awaiting surgery can comfortably sit and is there any suitable area where students and staff can be given instruction or teaching; if not, does this considerably limit educational possibilities.
      </para>
      <para>
       (14) Is the development of a new operating theatre block at the hospital urgently required and paramount to the development of the hospital as a whole; if so, will the Minister approve this development as a matter of urgency.

        â€”The Minister for Veterans' Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question:
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       (1) I understand that the operating theatre block at the Repatriation General Hospital, Daw Park, was built in 1942. In 1963 a urology theatre was added and in 1975 the two major theatres were partially renovated to remove a number of deficiencies.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) (a) While the potential for infection does exist, extraordinary care is taken by the staff to preserve sterility of drapes on the trays during movement about the theatres and (b) Yes.
      </para>
      <para>
       (3) (a) With the increase in the number of surgical cases in recent years it is necessary to maintain tighter control on theatre utilisation and ensure that sufficient time is available for staff to clean the theatres and to prevent any risk of 'dirty' cases causing infection in 'clean' cases, (b) Yes and (c) Careful and continuous monitoring of infection rates in surgical cases shows that cleaning and scheduling measures undertaken by the staff are effective and that there is no added risk to patients.
      </para>
      <para>
       (4) Some selected procedures such as cardiac pacemaker insertion are performed in the endoscopy room. However, the surgeon undertaking these procedures ensures that precautions are taken to fully protect the patient.
      </para>
      <para>
       (5) (a) The existing air conditioning system does create potential for infection. However, regular environmental monitoring is performed to ensure safe bacteriological conditions and (b) The existing air conditioning system does have difficulty maintaining full temperature control during heat wave conditions. Surgical sessions are cancelled when the operating theatres become too hot for surgery in order to avoid unnecessary risks to patients. The anaesthetists and theatre staff take all necessary precautions against the effects of temperature variation on patients.
      </para>
      <para>
       (6) Problems with the theatre floor coverings have been detected in the regular and rigorous inspections of the theatres. However, preventative measures and close monitoring ensure that the potential for growth of bacteria is controlled.
      </para>
      <para>
       (7) An organism was detected in the theatres on one occasion. However, this was quickly and effectively controlled. Continuous monitoring and adequate cleaning procedures ensure that the potential for growth of bacteria is adequately controlled.
      </para>
      <para>
       (8) The two main operating theatres are in direct and open communication with each other, but care is taken to ensure that no cross-contamination occurs.
      </para>
      <para>
       (9) Due to the limited size of the recovery room there are times when the number of surgical cases results in some overcrowding. However, when insufficient space is available, patients are returned to their ward where the necessary staff care is provided.
      </para>
      <para>
       (10) Facilities for the anaesthetising of patients in the operating theatre complex are limited. However, despite this shortcoming, patients undergoing anaesthesia are not put at risk. On occasions it has been found necessary to use the recovery room for patients requiring local anaesthetic. It has also been found necessary on occasions to administer general anaesthesia to patients in the main operating theatres themselves. In these circumstances the staff are careful to minimise any possible distress to patients.
      </para>
      <para>
       (11) Storage facilities in the operating theatre complex are inadequate and some equipment is stored in the main theatre corridors. Staff are careful to ensure that equipment is protected from damage.
      </para>
      <para>
       (12) Equipment storage facilities are inadequate and some problems have been experienced. By careful attention to maintenance, this problem is minimised.
      </para>
      <para>
       (13) Out-patient waiting facilities and areas for student teaching are limited within the operating theatres.
      </para>
      <para>
       (14) New theatres are required and a proposal for replacement of the operating theatre complex is currently under consideration.

       (2) Presidential Directive 59 does not constitute a change in US strategy from countervalue to counterforce.

I would draw to his attention in particular however the following sentences:

       </para>

      <para>
       A number of attempts have been made to compare different countries' spending on social security as a percentage of GDP or GNP.
      </para>
      <para>
       Unfortunately such studies encounter a number of definitional and technical problems. These problems are discussed in an article 'International Comparisons of Social Security Expenditure', that appeared in Social Security Quarterly, Winter/Spring 1977, Vol. 5, No. 1.
      </para>
      <para>
       International comparisons of social security expenditure may be misleading for a number of reasons.
      </para>
      <para>
       Some of the problems are:
      </para>
      <para>
       comparisons generally include only direct public sector expenditure and do not include contributions towards welfare outside the public sector;
      </para>
      <para>
       taxation concessions or deductions may be provided instead of or as well as cash payments;
      </para>
      <para>
       other forms of subsidies towards living costs may not be included in the total of welfare expenditure;
      </para>
      <para>
       differing economic circumstances (e.g. level of unemployment) will require differing levels of social security expenditure.
      </para>
      <para>
       For these and other reasons international comparisons of social security expenditure are not only extremely difficult to make, but are of limited value for ascertaining the adequacy of such expenditure in meeting the welfare needs of communities.
      </para>
      <para>
       Expenditure by OECD countries on education, income maintenance and health during the early 1960s and mid 1970s formed part of a study by the OECD in 1978 (Public Expenditure Trends, Studies in Resource Allocation, OECD, June 1978-see especially Table 6). However, the study warned that problems of data availability and their interpretation limit the conclusions which could be drawn. In addition, it was stressed that since the countries concerned differ in terms of their historical experience with public expenditure, their institutions, and their national tastes and values, caution should be exercised when basing conclusions on such international comparisons.

      <para>
       (4) The leasing of immovable property to taxable persons is a taxable transaction. This allows the lessee a deduction for tax paid to the lessor.
      </para>
      <para>
       (5) The 'zero rate' treats the taxable item as incurring a rate of zero on its sale, but allows a credit for tax paid on purchases. Thus an item taxed at a rate of zero bears no tax. This is in contrast to an exempt transaction where no tax is charged on the sale, but no deduction or credit is allowed for tax paid on purchases.
      </para>
      <para>
       (6) The normal rate of VAT generally applicable to all taxable transactions is 19 per cent on the taxable base including the VAT itself. Thus the effective rate is 23.46 per cent on the taxable base excluding VAT itself.

       (1) Has the Minister's attention been drawn to (a) an article by Jan Mayman in the National Times, 15-21 March 1981 (page 4), pointing out hazards of the use of Depo-Provera as a contraceptive and (b) the reported banning of the drug in the United States of America.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) If so, will the Minister take steps (a) to recommend to Australian doctors that the drug not be used for Aboriginal women and (b) to ensure that special efforts be made in advising them to ensure that they (i) understand the available alternatives, (ii) have an opportunity to discuss these with an informed person who can communicate effectively with them, with time to make an informed choice, especially in view of the reported high incidence among Aborigines of diabetes and other conditions which allegedly increase the hazards of use of the drug.
      </para>
      <para>
       (3) If the Minister will not take these actions, will he request that all users of Depo-Provera for contraception be recorded for statistical analysis of (a) safety, (b) side-effects and (c) reliability.

        â€”The Minister for Aboriginal Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question:

      </talk.start>
      <para>
       (1) Yes.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) I am informed that Depo-Provera has been available on the Australian market for many years for use in certain indications but not including use as a contraceptive. The Australian Drug Evaluation Committee which advises my colleague, the Minister for Health, on matters relating to the importation and distribution of drugs in Australia, has considered progressively available information on Depo-Provera for contraceptive use on a number of occasions. The Committee is of the opinion that this use of the drug must be regarded as investigational since there are unresolved questions related to its safety for this indication. This statement is included in the product information distributed by the Company for this drug.
      </para>
      <para>
       As with any drug which is regarded as investigational, ethics dictate that, where the medical practitioner is of the opinion that special circumstances warrant the use of such a drug, there is a responsibility on his part both for adequately informing the patient or the guardian, and for any adverse consequences of the therapy.
      </para>
      <para>
       In regard to 'informed consent', I appreciate that special care is required in respect of Aboriginal patients. My Department encourages additional training in cultural matters for doctors and other medical professionals who propose to work in areas where there is a significant Aboriginal population and supports the provision of orientation and in-service courses. In addition, most State Health Departments, often with Commonwealth support, employ Aboriginal Health Workers, several hundreds in all, who have important liaison roles. Both of these measures are designed to achieve the quality of communication necessary to ensure that Aboriginal patients are at ease with and have clear understanding in, their contacts with health care personnel.
      </para>
      <para>
       (3) I have brought the honourable member's suggestion to the notice of my colleague, the Minister for Health.

       One of the Government's main objectives during the recent Multilateral Trade Negotiations was to obtain a substantial reduction in the wool tariff in the United States of America. The USA is the only major industrialised country to maintain a duty on raw wool imports.

       This reduction is being phased in over three years, from 25.5 cents per lb (clean equivalent) to 10 cents per lb. Phasing commenced on 1 January 1980 and the current rate of duty is 15 cents per lb.

       No such studies have been undertaken. Flexitime schemes, once introduced within certain parameters, are a matter for administration by individual departments. In providing departments with advice on the administrative arrangements to be applied in relation to industrial action, the Public Service Board has stated that under no circumstances should staff who absent themselves without authority be permitted to claim any period of their absence as flexitime.

       None. Although great use was made of these Committees in the immediate post-war years and through the 1950's, they have not been used since the early 1960's. The establishment and continuing review of employment groups in the Service, following the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission's decisions in the Professional Engineers' Case in 1961, the broadbanding of classification structures, and the tendency to take to arbitration those classification issues which could not be resolved by conciliation, has created a situation in which the establishment of Central classification Committees has not been warranted.

       (2) It has always been the Government's view that legal aid should be provided by both private legal practitioners and salaried lawyers. The legislation establishing the State and Australian Capital Territory Commissions provide accordingly. The Government, however, does maintain a continuing scrutiny of the effectiveness of existing arrangements for the provision of legal aid, so that funds can be most effectively, efficiently, and economically applied. The Government has provided funds for a cost comparison study between salaried and private lawyers. This study is expected to be completed later this year, and the results will be closely considered. It should be noted that all State and Territory Commissions are independent statutory authorities and hence it will be primarily for those Commissions to decide whether any changes should be made to existing arrangements.

      <para>
       (1) and (2) The Tasmanian Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works in its hearings into the proposal for a group laundry at the Launceston General Hospital received oral and written submissions from the Textile Care and Rental Association of Tasmania supporting the use of commercial laundry services at Launceston. After considering the submissions and evidence and hearing evidence from the Tasmanian Department of Health Services and a special laundry consultant appointed by the Tasmanian Department of Health Services, the Committee concluded-
      </para>
      <para>
       'The Committee does not think that commercial laundries are the right solution to future increased demand even though their premises could be expanded. It is felt that there is validity in the opinion that, as far as possible, laundry should be serviced and treated on a hospital site where there are laboratory facilities for testing bacteriological problems and adequate specialised supervision.'
      </para>
      <para>
       The Committee went on to recommend that a new group laundry be built at Launceston. This recommendation was accepted by the Tasmanian Parliament. The conclusion and recommendation are in line with general practice adopted by Commonwealth and State health authorities for the provision of laundry services for hospitals; approximately 95 per cent of hospital laundry is handled by specialist laundries.

       In 1973 the community formed the Wreck Bay Aboriginal Housing Company Ltd to negotiate with the Commonwealth for a lease of land for the community. In 1975 the Company accepted an offer of lease, but subsequently lodged a list of additional claims rejecting the previously accepted offer.

       Negotiations have continued since that time but the matter is still unresolved. Two major obstacles are the community's claims for:

       Apart from housing at Wreck Bay Government housing assistance in the Australian Capital Territory in the form of rental housing, rental rebates for government tenants on low incomes, and finance to assist with the purchase of government or private dwellings is available to Aboriginal people who live or work in the Australian Capital Territory under precisely the same conditions as it is available to other members of the Australian Capital Territory community.

The same situation would arise with any other pool in the Australian Capital Territory being used as a training facility by Institute swimmers.

       I am advised that the Australian Film and Television School meets its employer superannuation liability in accordance with the Superannuation Act 1976. Payments are made to the Commonwealth in respect of those employees who are contributors to the Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme. The rate of contribution paid by the Australian Film and Television School and a number of other Authorities does not take account of the cost of pension up-dating. An actuarial assessment is being obtained of the extent to which the present contribution rate differs from that required to meet the full accruing superannuation liability (including the cost of up-dating). This assessment is not expected to be available for some time.

       Officers wishing to make a personal long distance call do so by booking the call through their local switchboard operator and are required to reimburse the Department for the cost of the call.
      </para>
      <para>
       Because of the decentralised nature of the Department (operating out of nearly 200 locations throughout the metropolitan areas and major country centres) there is a constant need for staff to use STD facilities in the normal course of their duties. This requirement considerably complicates the arrangements necessary to bar access to STD processes. Nevertheless the Department has installed STD access barring in those offices where it is administratively practicable and cost efficient and where the switchboard equipment is compatible. As non-suitable switchboard equipment is progressively replaced, access barring will be extended.
      </para>
      <para>
       (3) Due to the decentralised nature of the Department, it is felt that the number of monitoring devices that would need to be purchased and the staff resources that would be required to co-ordinate, investigate and report on monitored details would not be cost effective and in some instances, particularly in remote regional offices, could prove to be counter-productive.

Central Office, Canberra, telephones generally are STD access barred with access being restricted to senior officers and special areas able to satisfy a rigorous test of essentiality, e.g. computer links and special operational areas. Those elements of Central Office presently located in Melbourne are accommodated in several buildings. Where technically feasible STD access has been restricted on the same scale as Canberra but some areas cannot be access barred because of the age of switchboard equipment. These areas are monitored with the Telecom Australia PETRA, (PBX Extension Traffic Recorder and Analyser) device which has been found to be effective in reducing unauthorised STD traffic.

       Most Regional Offices of the Department are access barred on the same basis as Central Office.

       On 17 October 1978 Health Program Grants were offered to the ten established Aboriginal controlled medical services to meet the salary and associated costs of staff involved in the clinical activities. Other costs are met by the Department of Aboriginal Affairs. The arrangement was introduced against the then possible non-continuance of bulk billing which would have adversely affected the Services concerned. Acceptance of a Health Program Grant precludes continuance of bulk billing for medical services and avoids double payment which would otherwise be the case. Economic restraints preclude the expansion of the arrangement to other more recently established services.

In 1980-81 Health Program Grant funds have been made available to 8 of these services, with negotiations continuing in respect of another.

       (1) Yes. However the incident referred to occurred on a highway in New South Wales when a semi-trailer carrying a mixed cargo was involved in an accident. The cargo included two radioactive sources. These sources were properly packaged, were not breached in the accident and did not constitute a radiation hazard.
      </para>

       (2), (3) and (4) The authority responsible for this matter is the New South Wales Health Commission which has investigated the incident thoroughly. I understand that the Commission is entirely satisfied that the radiation consequences were negligible.
      </para>
      <para>
       (5) When radiation accidents do occur local radiation monitoring is always carried out by the appropriate State or Territory health authority. National radiation safety standards have been developed under the aegis of the National Health and Medical Research Council and are, in fact, applied uniformly throughout Australia under the relevant health legislation prevailing in each State or Territory.
      </para>

       My Department maintains a national registry of radiation incidents through the Australian Radiation Laboratory. Whenever a significant radiation incident occurs the relevant health authority provides a detailed summary of its history and consequences to the Australian Radiation Laboratory. The Laboratory arranges for its circulation to warn of potential circumstances which may lead to similar incidents in the future.

       The guiding principle, enunciated by the Australian Government, is that it would not contemplate entering into any new trading arrangements with New Zealand except on the basis of equality of fair trading opportunities between industries in the two countries.

       Senior Australian and New Zealand officials discussed closer economic relations in Wellington on 11 and 12 March 1981. This meeting was held against the background of recent consideration of the issues by Australian Ministers and separately by New Zealand Ministers. The objective of the discussions was to ensure a full understanding of ministerial attitudes on both sides and to clarify differences in position. Resolution of such differences will be necessary before details of any proposed new arrangements can be made public. I should like to emphasise that the Government has given an undertaking that no substantive decisions will be taken on this matter until full and meaningful consultations have been held with all interested parties.

       (1) I think it must be accepted that tax evasion resulting from unrecorded transactions that go to make up the 'cash' or 'underground' economy has a bearing on the rates of income tax. The taxation laws are, of course, designed to raise a substantial portion of the revenue necessary to meet essential Government expenditure. As a general proposition, therefore, indulgence by some sections of the community in tax evasion practices, whether through participation in the cash economy or not, would increase the taxation burden borne by the general body of taxpayers who comply with the revenue laws.
      </para>
      <para>
       I do not accept, however, the implication in the honourable Member's question that taxation rates under this Government are higher than those under previous Governments and draw his attention to the personal income tax reforms introduced by this Government since coming to power.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) The Commissioner of Taxation has informed me that Taxation Office enforcement programmes covering investigation and audit activities are directed essentially at the detection of unreported transactions. These activities entail examinations of the affairs of taxpayers, including those engaged in illegal activities, with a view to detecting income not disclosed in income tax returns. Special techniques are employed to detect unreported income, including a process under which the assets accumulated by a taxpayer over a period of time are quantified together with other amounts of expenditure. Such examinations have, the Commissioner said, been successful in recovering substantial amounts of tax which would otherwise have been lost to the revenue. Enforcement activities also include action to detect persons who are obliged, but who have failed, to lodge income tax returns. Experience has shown that persons found to be evading tax through non-lodgment of returns are, more often than not, participants in the cash economy.
      </para>
      <para>
       A detailed account of the results achieved from all Taxation Office enforcement programmes was contained in the Commissioner's 59th Report to Parliament.

        â€”The Minister for National Development and Energy has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question:
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       (1) (a) and (b) At the end of July last year, the River Murray Commission released for public comment a report which identifies river regulation and related forest management problems along the River Murray between Tocumwal and Echuca, associated with the Barmah-Millewa forests. The report examines a number of possible measures to alleviate the problems. Solutions to some of the problems fall outside the Commission's area of responsibility. However, I understand that submissions received from a number of individuals and organisations are under consideration prior to the Commission deciding on what future action it can take to remedy any problems.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) As indicated in the report, forest managers estimate that effective watering would require the maintenance at Tocumwal of a flow of at least 24,500 megalitres per day for about one month during the winter-spring period or a consumptive use of about 100,000 megalitres of water on each side of the river in any one year; at this stage, this is a matter for the decision of the State concerned.
      </para>
      <para>
       (3) According to River Murray streamflow records maintained by the Commission, the criteria suggested in (2) above were last met in the spring of 1978. Forest interests maintain that prior to intensive regulation of the Murray River for irrigation, winter and spring flooding over most parts of the forests occurred in about 4 out of 5 years and that this regime should be restored by artificial means.
      </para>
      <para>
       (4) No; I understand that minor flooding of relatively small areas of the forests, but sufficient to limit access, has occurred on two occasions during the current autumn season due to temporary high river flows when irrigation diversions from Lake Mulwala were temporarily interrupted because of rain. Some foresters have stated that under the prevailing dry conditions such minor flooding is beneficial to the forests.
      </para>
      <para>
       (5) and (6) I understand that the River Murray Commission is reasonably confident that significant containment of summer/autumn flooding can be achieved and such flooding is not likely to pose any great threat to the health of the forests. I also understand that a by-pass measure proposed in the Commission's report, i.e., the use of Mulwala Canal to by-pass water around the Barmah forest reach of the river, has already been successfully put into effect. Investigations are also proceeding on the need for channel maintenance work to improve the channel carrying capacity.

      <para>
       The overriding objective of export inspection service is to ensure that product subject to the Exports (Fish) Regulations meets prescribed conditions and restrictions. In particular, export establishments are required to be constructed and equipped to operate in an efficient and hygienic manner; and products are required to be of an acceptable quality and accurately described. Constant monitoring of registered land based premises and registered vessels is undertaken to ensure the maintenance of standards.

      <para>
       The Commonwealth Government provides support for the education of deaf children through its Special Education Program, administered by the Schools Commission.
      </para>
      <para>
       Through this Program the Government provides support for the education of all handicapped children by supplementing the funding of government and non-government special schools and special classes in regular schools. In the case of Government schools, it does this by making block grants available to each State on condition that these grants be spent on the education of handicapped children. It leaves to the State concerned the determination of priorities within Special Education programs. Grants to declared non-government special schools, are recommended to the Commonwealth Education Minister by State Education Departments for approval. Thereafter grants are applied by the education authorities and schools concerned. Each State has programs related to the education of deaf children.
      </para>
      <para>
       Expenditure priorities, and consequently the level of funding to be applied to supporting the education of deaf children are determined, therefore, by government and non-government education authorities in the States and the Northern Territory.
      </para>
      <para>
       A further element of the Commonwealth Special Education Program under which deaf children may benefit is the program to assist the integration of handicapped children into regular schools. Under this program priority is to be given to the movement of as many children as possible from special to regular schools. Funds may also be used to enable isolated handicapped children to attend neighbourhood regular schools, to test new ways of fully or partially integrating handicapped children already integrated into regular schools and to facilitate the enrolment in regular primary schools of handicapped children who are beginning their formal schooling.

      <para>
       (1) It is not possible to provide the information sought with any acceptable degree of accuracy. However, during the year ended 30 June 1980, formal determinations in transfer pricing cases, in accordance with section 136 of the Income Tax Assessment Act and/or the relevant provisions of Australia's double taxation agreements, were made on nine occasions. At the end of that year, several other cases were under consideration for application of section 136 and/or the agreement provisions.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) No firm estimate can be placed on the tax revenue that might be recouped following the enactment of provisions to replace the existing section 260. It would necessarily require the passage of considerable time before the efficacy of such new provisions, once introduced, could be tested and determined. However, it has been estimated that taxpayer involvement in avoidance schemes that gave rise to claims for artificial losses and deductions resulted in revenue short-falls of $230m and $280m in the 1978-79 and 1979-80 financial years respectively. An allowance of $300m for tax avoidance has been incorporated in the estimates for 1980-81. These amounts relate to schemes against which specific legislative action has been or is being taken. I should add that the Commissioner of Taxation is contesting claims under these schemes and that the amount of revenue ultimately forgone because of them will only be determined upon resolution of the issues by the Courts.

       (1) (a) Telecom has decided to introduce a charge of $10 per annum for silent line services, to be applied from the publication date in respect of all telephone directories issued after 1st July 1981. This charge is to help offset the costs being incurred in handling Directory Assistance enquiries in relation to this type of service; (b) Telecom is introducing on a progressive basis a Call Charge Record (CCR) system which will automatically record details of subscriber dialled international calls, including the time the call is made, the number called and the cost of the call. At present, the system is being introduced at selected exchanges in the capital cities. With the introduction of the CCR system at an exchange, ISD will be provided to all subscribers connected to that exchange as a standard facility and a separate total for any ISD calls made will appear on their telephone bills. This is distinct from the ISD facility which has been provided on a multi-metering basis, with the charges for ISD calls being recorded on subscribers' meters along with local and STD calls. Because of this bulk billing feature, the ISD facility has been provided only to those subscribers who specifically request it.
      </para>
      <para>
       As mentioned ISD/CCR is being progressively introduced as a standard facility and, should any subscriber wish to take less than full advantage of the telephone service, there is a standard fee of $3 per annum imposed by Telecom for restricting the service in the required way.

       (3) My Department does not inquire into the ethnic origins of applicants for admission to Australia and no definitive answer to this question could be provided. However, an examination of the names of those arriving from Timor over recent years would suggest that while some are ethnic Timorese, the majority are of Chinese ethnic origin. (A similar examination of names suggests that about two thirds of the people on the agreed list were of Chinese ethnic origin-this reflects the ethnic composition of the original evacuees to whom these people are related.)

       (4) Timorese require permission from the Indonesian authorities both to travel to Jakarta and later to leave Indonesia for Australia. Allegations have been made to my Department that bribes were sought and accepted by Indonesian officials in return for these permits. These allegations have been drawn to the attention of the Indonesian authorities by the Australian Embassy, Jakarta, with expressions of official concern.

The Indonesian authorities are aware of the importance the Australian Government attaches to a speedy completion of this program and the Government will continue to pursue this aim.

       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       (1) Increases in contribution rates charged by a registered health benefits organisation are generally approved to finance higher benefit payments, thus ensuring the continued financial viability of the organisation. Increases in contributions are based on the whole membership of an organisation and not on an individual contributor basis, as is the case in other forms of general insurance. Accordingly, the date of application to all contributors of any contribution increase becomes an important factor because higher benefits usually become payable to all contributors from the same date. It is not uncommon for organisations to adjust automatically contributions paid several months in advance to take into account any increase in contribution rates. It is generally simpler for organisations to reduce the period for which advance contributions have been paid than to seek a lump sum adjustment.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) Organisations usually provide discounts on contributions paid in advance of up to four weeks in a year. This discount takes into account the advantages accruing to organisations from advance contributions i.e. savings in collection costs and interest earned. In the circumstances, the point raised by the honourable member should be considered in this light. The matter of the treatment of advance contributions is basically determined by organisations themselves and I would not propose to vary this arrangement.

      <para>
       Detailed submissions prepared by Telecom Australia concerning the suitability of Christmas Island for use as a transmitting station by Radio Australia were considered by the Independent Inquiry into Radio Australia chaired by Sir Keith Waller CBE. In Section 12.2 of its Report of December 1975, the Inquiry found that this site offered transmission advantages over Darwin and Carnarvon to certain prime target areas; however, in the light of Radio Australia's priorities, high cost, and the difficulties of operating such a station, it concluded that these advantages were not great enough to justify establishment at Christeas Island.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Inter-Departmental Committee which considered the recommendations of the Waller Report, found that these reasons were still valid. Eventually it was decided to restore the Radio Australia facilities at Cox Peninsula.

       In 1978 agreement was reached between Mr Warby and my Department to a 'one-time' Service of the J34 engine fitted to the 'Spirit of Australia' in preparation for his attempt on the world water speed record. In recent years the J34 type engine has been used as the major training engine for engine fitters at the RAAF School of Technical Training, Wagga. These engines are stripped, rebuilt, test run, and calibrated by trainees as part of their training. As Mr Warby's engine was the only one in Australia fitted with an afterburner it provided an excellent opportunity to demonstrate and teach afterburner operations to trainees whilst at the same time directly benefiting RAAF morale.
      </para>
      <para>
       (a) Mr Warby signed a form of indemnity in which he agreed to provide all materials required to service the engine and to indemnify the Commonwealth and its Servicemen or servants against any claims that might arise as a result of the servicing.

       On 4 July 1980 I signed an order under Section 13 of the Migration Act 1958 for the deportation of Mr Collins. Subsequently Mr Collins applied to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal for the order to be reviewed. On 22 January 1981 the Tribunal affirmed my decision.

       (2) If Mr Collins is deported, administrative action will be taken to prevent his return. Past experience has shown that, by adopting false identities and abusing the travel facilitation arrangements agreed between Australia and New Zealand, some criminal deportees have attempted, or have been able, to re-enter Australia. This is one of a number of reasons which influenced the Government to decide that persons claiming the benefits of the Trans-Tasman Travel Arrangement will be asked to identify themselves and to satisfy officials at points of entry that they are entitled to enter Australia. Passport checks have been introduced for this purpose.

       The Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs is engaged in a study of prohibited immigrants in Australia and of methods and procedures by which it can more effectively use its resources to control prohibited immigration. It is not desirable that details of methods and procedures be made public.
      </para>
      <para>
       I can say, however, that I have asked the Department to take vigorous action to achieve a substantial reduction in the number of overstayed visitors, to ask potential or actual prohibited immigrants to leave Australia and, as a last resort, to effect deportation when so ordered. I have written to the State and Northern Territory Ministers responsible for immigration and ethnic affairs matters and have discussed with them the possibility of denying prohibited immigrants access to certain services provided free to Australian residents or heavily subsidised by Australian taxpayers.
      </para>
      <para>
       During the period of the Regularisation of Status Program which operated throughout the second half of 1980 the Department's staff was directed to that program rather than to seeking out prohibited immigrants. As I have made clear, people illegally in Australia who did not take advantage of that last opportunity to regularise their immigration status or who were ineligible to apply cannot expect to be allowed to remain in Australia after the program concluded. Action to detect, apprehend and deal with prohibited immigrants has again been stepped up. The rate of detection has increased in recent weeks. In April it was a monthly record. Prosecutions for working without authority have been instituted successfully. It is expected that as a result of the action taken and under further examination it will be possible to reduce the number of prohibited immigrants in Australia.

      <para>
       The difference between figures in the table Deportation Orders Made on page 52 of Review '80, and the table Deportations Carried Out, is attributable to the time lag incurred in many deportations, mainly due to the following factors:
      </para>
      <para>
       (i) deportation orders made include people whose whereabouts were not known at the time and as it takes a considerable time to locate many of them, their deportation is not necessarily carried out within the same statistical period;
      </para>
      <para>
       (ii) orders made against criminals are not executed until the deportees complete the custodial portion of their prison sentences; and
      </para>
      <para>
       (iii) some deportees contest the decision to order their deportation by legal challenge through the courts or through review of the decision by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal.
      </para>
      <para>
       A further reason for the difference between orders made and deportations carried out is that it is normal practice for any fresh information or new circumstances to be considered before an order in force for some time is executed. As a consequence some deportation orders are revoked. Precise statistics are not kept.

      <para>
       All provisional sums form part of the contract. The majority of works covered by them are undertaken by specialist sub-contractors who tender separately and are required on acceptance by the Principal to enter into a contract with the prime contractor. Other provisional sums may be included for unforeseen work to be carried out where the contract calls for alteration works in existing premises and for items included in the works but for which the design documentation is not complete at the time of calling tenders.

       (2) Settlers are residentially eligible for the grant of citizenship after 3 years' residence in Australia. Persons with three months' service with the permanent armed forces of Australia are exempted from this general provision. There is discretion to waive the residence requirement in the case of spouses, widows or widowers of Australian citizens, or spouses of persons approved for the grant of citizenship, former Australians, and persons under 21 years of age.

       Without a breakdown of the 328,730 settlers arriving between 1975 and 1979 in categories such as the foregoing, it is not possible to give an accurate answer. However, it is likely that about 150,000 of the settlers who arrived between January 1975 and June 1979 would have become residentially qualified to apply for Australian citizenship during that period. Most of those who arrived before April 1978 would have met the residential requirements by now.

      <para>
       (1) and (2) Since 1 March 1981 there has been a total of 41 complaints received of interference to services, other than amateur, in the HF bands, 4 of which can be attributed to Over the Horizon Radar and the remainder to other sources such as electrical interference, unlicensed stations and other overseas services. The complaints were received from the operators of the licensed services affected.
      </para>
      <para>
       In addition, fifteen Amateur Stations reported interference to the amateur bands indicating the source to be from an over the horizon radar transmitter at Kiev, USSR. A further twelve amateurs reported interference to amateur bands from a variety of sources, and in some cases, the interference described could well be from other amateur stations.
      </para>
      <para>
       My Department has received no complaints from responsible authorities concerning interference from over the horizon radar to air-to-ground, ship to shore or land mobile radio links. No interference has been observed on or near any of the safety channels which are recognised by international agreement.
      </para>
      <para>
       2 (c) It is possible that difficulty could be experienced with distress calls if these radar transmissions are made on or adjacent to frequencies assigned for distress calls at the time a distress call is made. However, there is no evidence available within my Department to indicate that any distress calls have been impaired to the extent that a call has been lost as a result of such interference.
      </para>
      <para>
       Departmental monitoring stations have observed OHR signals on 27.880 MHz, the frequency used for distress in the Australian Inshore Boating Radiocommunication Service (IBRS).
      </para>
      <para>
       3 (a) My Department is aware of the general belief that the OHR signals are coming from a site or sites near Kiev in Russia. My Department's monitoring of these transmissions while not being conclusive, does not conflict with this belief.
      </para>
      <para>
       3 (b) No. However, my Department has initiated communication with the USSR seeking their co-operation in avoiding interference to the 27.880 MHz safety channel used by the IBRS.

Realisation of this goal would enhance the commercialisation of many technologies which are based on solar cells.

       (1) The Auditor-General over the past five years has criticised the management of the Defence computing program and its capabilities in relation to:
      </para>
      <para>
       (a) Honeywell Computer Operations-Criticism of Honeywell operations centred on reliability and maintenance of Honeywell machines and the ability to maintain an essential service until systems were transferred to Univac. These problems were addressed by the installation of an additional Honeywell H8200 in June 1978.
      </para>
      <para>
       (b) System Development-In 1976-77 the Auditor-General commented on an apparent lack of an approved plan detailing a timetable for the transfer of systems from Honeywell to Univac. This area has since been subjected to rigorous estimating, resource and project control procedures. A Schedule of Activity and Achievement was approved in September 1977 and has been updated regularly to reflect the current position. This schedule is endorsed yearly by a high level Policy Committee. In his 1979-80 report the Auditor-General noted the continued improvements in project control and that new systems development and design methodology is planned for introduction in 1981; this is expected to result in further improvement.
      </para>
      <para>
       (c) Mini Computers-Criticism in this area referred to slippage of target dates, apparent over manning of data preparation operator positions at the larger RAAF bases and problems of site works and accommodation. Development and implementation of systems on mini computers is now progressing substantially according to target dates. More work is being done on data preparation establishment criteria. Site modifications are done as funds allow.
      </para>
      <para>
       (d) Micrographics-In 1977-78 the Auditor-General referred to Defence placing work with outside contractors instead of the Micrographics Service Bureau of the Australian Government Publishing Service. All micrographic output produced by Defence Computing Division is now processed by AGPS.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) Two mainframe computers, models 1100-82, are installed in separate locations. Each is working 10 shifts per week. A third mainframe, also an 1100-82, approved in January 1981, is expected to be installed at a third location by mid 1982.

       (2) (a) Alignment of freight rates upon formation of the Australia Middle East Gulf Conference on 1 March 1980 resulted in a substantial effective increase in the freight rate being applied by the shipping line carrying the bulk of meat cargoes to the Gulf area. Subsequently, the Conference reached agreement with the Australian Shippers Council on a 17 1/2 per cent increase in freight rates from 10 July 1980. Meat shipper representatives did not accept this increase negotiated in the Shippers Council and the Australian Meat and Livestock Corporation (AMLC), on behalf of meat shippers, conducted separate negotiations with the Conference. No agreement emerged from those negotiations.
      </para>
      <para>
       The outcome was that the AMLC, with the approval of the Minister for Primary Industry, invoked powers available in its Act and set a maximum freight rate providing for a 12 1/2 per cent increase in meat freight rates from 4 July 1980. Subsequent discussions between AMLC and the Conference on 8 December 1980 resulted in agreement by both parties to a further 5 per cent increase in meat freight rates to apply for one year from 1 January 1981.
      </para>
      <para>
       As a result of these arrangements, shippers of refrigerated meat had the benefit for six months of a 5 per cent lower freight rate than otherwise would have applied. Additionally, there will be no further increase in the Conference base rates during 1981.
      </para>
      <para>
       (b) The Australian Meat and Livestock Corporation has kept the matter of available capacity and alternative carriers under constant review. The Corporation has from time to time met with representatives of lines serving the Middle East region other than those of the Australia Middle East Gulf Conference. It is understood that these non-conference lines have achieved a reasonable degree of success and have attracted a sizeable proportion of the refrigerated meat volume being lifted to Middle East destinations.
      </para>
      <para>
       (3) The AMLC has responsibility under its enabling legislation, the AMLC Act 1977, to negotiate freight rates and other conditions of carriage on behalf of the meat industry with Conference Lines and other carriers. The Act provides for Ministerial approval for shipping arrangements made by the Corporation. In the Government's view the AMLC has discharged this responsibility satisfactorily to date.
      </para>
      <para>
       In addition, the Government is represented at freight rate negotiations between the Australian Shippers Council and Conference Lines under the provisions of Part 10 of the Trade Practices Act 1974.

      <para>
       (1) The recent major Indonesian joint exercise, which was held in eastern Indonesia from 18 March to 1 April, involved the deployment of some 35,000 men together with naval ships and aircraft. The exercise was conducted in three separate locations in eastern Indonesia-Timor, Maluku, and Irian Jaya. The exercise was part of a continuing program of exercises being held throughout Indonesia aimed at upgrading the defensive capability of Indonesia's armed forces. The previous exercise in 1980 was conducted in the First National Defence Area Command which covers Sumatra and West Kalimantan.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) and (3) The Australian Defence Attache, together with a number of other military attaches from other countries resident in Jakarta, observed all parts of the exercise at the invitation of the Indonesian Government.
      </para>
      <para>
       (4) Matters relating to security in the Indonesian province of East Timor are the direct domestic responsibility of the Indonesian Government, and it is not for me to speculate on Indonesian Government intentions. I am able to say, that the Defence Attache's report of the Timor segment of the exercise contained no indication that the exercise was anything more than an exercise. However, it is possible that Fretelin guerilla remnants continue to be active in parts of the province and it would be expected that Indonesian forces conduct operations against them.

       (2) I am also aware that Mr Rosenblatt submitted his resignation as Head of the United States Delegation to the Micronesian Political Status Negotiations to the incoming President. This action is normal procedure for holders of executive office in the United States after the election of a new President. A successor to Mr Rosenblatt has not yet been appointed by the new Administration, and the negotiations remain suspended for the time being. However, the failure to appoint a new Head of the United States Delegation need not necessarily delay the endorsement of the Compact of Free Association, although it does appear probable that termination of the Trusteeship this year will not be achieved.

       The cost of medical alert systems such as Vital Call which, it is understood, are primarily designed for use by elderly persons, is expenditure of a private or domestic nature which is not deductible for income tax purposes.
      </para>
      <para>
       While the advantages of such a system for use in many situations are appreciated, the benefit that a taxation deduction might provide would depend upon the taxable income of the person involved. Persons in receipt of higher incomes and least in need of financial assistance would benefit from a deduction while, for example, elderly persons with incomes below the amount at which tax becomes payable would obtain no benefit at all. In view of this, it is doubtful whether the income tax system is an appropriate means of providing relief to the users of such systems.

       (1) to (4) On 4 December 1980 I informed the House that the Government had reluctantly decided, on the basis of sound professional and technical advice, to postpone selection of the new tactical fighter aircraft until further data on both contending aircraft was available for evaluation. Until analysis of all the necessary information is completed, and the Government's decision on final selection made public, it would be premature for me to answer these questions or others like them.

        â€”The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       (1) On 4 December 1980 I informed the House that the Government saw no alternative but to await evaluation of further data around mid 1981 before adopting any view as to the relative merits of selection of either aircraft, the F-16 or F/A-18 for Australia's new Tactical Fighter. That position has not changed. Additional funding for travel by officers of my Department was required to enable the necessary further evaluations to be carried out.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) Yes.
      </para>
      <para>
       (3) and (4) Until analysis of all the necessary information is completed and the Government's decision on the final selection made public, it would be premature for me to answer these questions or others like them.
      </para>
      <para>
       (5) No.
      </para>
      <para>
       (6) On the assumption that senior personnel equate to Group Captain (Clerk Class 11/equivalent) and above, the answer is as follows:
      </para>
      <para>
       (a) Assessment Team Members
      </para>
      <para>
       (1) replaced-one Group Captain, (Note that the replacement has had previous experience with the Project).
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) no longer with the project-one Group Captain (post disestablished).
      </para>
      <para>
       (3) no longer with the Department of Defence-Nil.
      </para>
      <para>
       (b) Higher Defence Staff-following the 180 evaluation Deputy Secretary C, Mr D. H. Eltringham was appointed the Permanent Head of the former Department of Productivity.
      </para>
      <para>
       (7) No. All visits to the United States by officers responsible for assessment are for purposes of evaluation, not for purposes of familiarisation.
      </para>
      <para>
       (8) (a) There has been a reduction of two RAAF personnel and an increase of one civilian attached full time to the NTF project in Australia. However, one of the two RAAF posts was transferred to the USA for full-time project activities. This produced an increase of one full-time RAAF post in the USA. There were no increases in full-time civilian posts in the USA.
      </para>
      <para>
       (b) With regard to part time activities related to the NTF project there have been a number of specialist teams involved in the 1981 phase of the evaluation. While the same total number of people as in 1980 have been and will be involved in part-time duty in the USA, the requirement for specialists in particular areas of investigation has resulted in an increase in the requirement for what may be broadly termed scientific specialists. For this reason there will be an increase of three civilians and a decrease of three RAAF personnel when compared to the 1980 evaluation mission.
