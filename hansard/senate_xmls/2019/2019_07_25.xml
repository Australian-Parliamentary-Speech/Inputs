                <span class="HPS-Normal">There has been considerable doubt in respect of the constitutionality of this bill that the Senate is considering. The constitutionality of the measures contained in the Counter-Terrorism (Temporary Exclusion Orders) Bill 2019 effectively providing for the temporary exclusion of Australian citizens from their own country remains highly uncertain. In 1988 the High Court struck down a law that imposed an immigration clearance fee on all persons, including citizens arriving in Australia by air. The unanimous decision of the court confirmed that: </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">… the right of Australian citizens to enter the country is not qualified by any law imposing a need to obtain a licence or 'clearance' from the executive …</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Entry also cannot depend on holding a passport. There is no unqualified right to a passport, but legal advice to the government has long been to the effect that an Australian citizen cannot lawfully be denied entry even without a passport.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the 1960s the Australian government adopted stalling techniques to prevent Australian journalist Wilfred Burchett from returning. Burchett was a communist living overseas and was strictly condemned by the government as a traitor. He was repeatedly denied access to a passport. However, cabinet records released by the National Archives show that the government was well aware, on advice from the Attorney-General's Department, that Burchett could not lawfully be kept out of Australia. That advice was kept secret for more than 30 years. That's a bit of history, but the constitutional uncertainty about this bill is very current.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've had the President of the Law Council raising concerns about this. We have had Professor Helen Irving also raising concerns about this, but I can take you to the bill itself. If we go to section 30 of the bill, severability, it says, 'If section 14 is not a valid law of the Commonwealth'—you've got a contingency in here in the event that this is not constitutional. It's not me that's saying this, it's the government saying that this may not be constitutional. If this bill turns out not to be constitutional, you're going to remove the review right. We're talking about people—</span>

                  </a>  Yes, conditional legislation—thank you, Senator Wong. This is simply not acceptable. I know the government is of the view that you do not have to provide legal advice. That view is inconsistent with the laws of this country, and I refer you to <span style="font-style:italic;">Odgers</span>—if you care to read that over the weekend, you might learn a little bit about legal professional privilege—but, if there's any doubt about that, I refer you to Egan v Chadwick. The New South Wales Court of Appeal—I'm sure Senator Keneally will tell you all about it, because I think she was there at the time—said that the parliament has a right to see the legal advice upon which the government is making decisions. An essential part of the oversight role of the parliament is to make sure we fully understand what it is that you are presenting. In this case it's critically important. This is a matter of whether or not this bill is constitutional.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'll tell you in my second reading speech that we support the principles of the bill, but we don't want to have a situation where the first time a TEO is issued the matter ends up in the High Court. That's not the way we should be making laws. It's not good law unless we are satisfied as to its constitutionality. Some of the constitutional matters of concern relate to whether or not you can prohibit an Australian returning to Australia, and I think it's relatively clear that you can't stop an Australian coming to this country. That was the unanimous ruling of the High Court in 1988.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The second concern is the government's own concern, because it's in their bill, as to whether or not the review that they have established is lawful and whether or not they're actually using executive power to in some way constrain someone. When there's a control order, it has to be a judge that issues the control order. This is a step in a direction where ministers can in effect provide punitive action against Australian citizens without a court. We need to see that advice. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

The matters that Senator Patrick has raised in his contribution are appropriately dealt with in the context of the debate on legislation, which is now delayed because of the steps that he has taken.  This is government business time. This is a time for the government to bring on legislation. This is very important legislation. Let's remind ourselves what this is about. This is about making sure that the government of Australia has the capacity to appropriately manage risk in relation to Australians who have decided to fight as foreign terrorist fighters in overseas battle zones.

Then, after the House of Representatives decided to reject his views and reject the amendments he put forward, the Labor Party voted in favour of the bill as a whole. All of these matters that Senator Patrick just raised will be appropriately dealt with in the course of the debate on the legislation.

We would be going into the committee stage in consideration of this bill. During that committee consideration stage, it is of course open to Senator Patrick to ask questions of the minister dealing with the legislation to satisfy himself in relation to all of the issues he's concerned about. This is not the way to deal with these matters and it is preventing the government from properly pursuing its legislative agenda consistent with its business program here in the Senate.

Of course they should. It's not just Senator Patrick who thinks they should. It's not just the Australian Labor Party that thinks they should. The Law Council of Australia says they should. In fact, it was the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security, chaired by Liberal member Andrew Hastie and dominated by Liberal Party members, that made a recommendation that the government should release the Solicitor-General's advice and prove that this legislation is constitutional. In voting against this motion today, the government is voting against the recommendation made by its own Liberal dominated committee, with its own Liberal chair. Senators in this place—Senator Abetz, Senator Stokes and Senator Fawcett—put their names to a recommendation that called on the government to do exactly what Senator Patrick's motion is calling on the government to do here today.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's make no mistake about this. This is no small ask. This is no niggling request from Senator Patrick. This is, in fact, the very question that Australians want the answer to from this government, because Australians, this parliament, and, indeed, the Australian Labor Party want a temporary exclusion order scheme that works, that keeps Australians safe and that is constitutionally valid and will withstand a High Court challenge. It is no good this parliament passing legislation if that legislation gets thrown out by the High Court and Australians are left less safe than they would be had this legislation not passed. That is a farcical situation and yet it is the one the government is continuing to contemplate and leave in doubt.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me make clear that Labor will be doing a number of things in relation to Senator Patrick's motion. I advise the Senate that, if standing orders are suspended so that Senator Patrick can move his motion, I will move an amendment to paragraph (a) so that the motion reads, 'There be laid on the table by 11 am today by the minister.' I also advise that, because the opposition do not intend for this legislation to be delayed by this parliament, I will ask for the question to be divided so the opposition can support paragraph (a) and oppose paragraph (b).</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor have always supported the intent of the temporary exclusion order legislation. We supported it in the April report of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security. We supported the 18 substantive recommendations put forward by that Liberal dominated committee. We, in fact, are the party that have been consistent on the temporary exclusion order legislation. The flip-flopping has happened over there, on the government side, because you have Andrew Hastie, Julian Leeser, Senator Abetz, Senator Stoker and Senator Fawcett who have all put their names, and the Liberal Party's position, behind those 18 recommendations.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And what has the government done? It has rejected four of those recommendations in whole, it has rejected six of them in part and it has completely ignored one. And the one it has completely ignored is the subject of this motion here today. It has completely ignored the call from the Liberal-dominated Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security to produce advice from the Solicitor-General that shows that this legislation is constitutional.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is farcical for the government to say that they can't produce it, because they'll be waiving privilege. In fact, if they even talk about the content of the Solicitor-General's advice, they are waiving privilege. And when do they do that? They do it all the time. They do it every time they talk about the medevac legislation. Then they talk all about the content of the Solicitor-General's advice; they're more than happy to put it out there for the public to see. But when it comes to a fundamental question on this legislation, which is designed to keep Australians safe from terrorists, from foreign fighters, then this government—well, they just go weak. They cannot produce, for the parliament or the Australian public, the advice from the Solicitor-General that shows that their approach—which, as Senator McAllister has pointed out, is four years late, because the UK parliament did this very same thing in 2015—on this bill is constitutional.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We will support this legislation because we want to see Australians safe. But we put on the record that we have concerns, and the government has yet to allay them, as to whether this legislation is constitutional. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

I place on the record that, should Senator Patrick be enabled to move the substantive motion, the Australian Greens would support both part A and part B.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What this debate is fundamentally about is the doctrine of separation of powers, because what this legislation seeks to do is to establish Minister Peter Dutton as judge and jury and to allow him to impose punishment on Australian citizens for alleged criminal activities. That is simply not his job. I mean, Earth to the government: that's the job of our legal system. And the doctrine of separation of powers makes it clear that courts should be allowed to fulfil that function unencumbered. In fact, as a finding of the full court of the Federal Court of Australia provides, 'It is a fundamental principle of the Australian Constitution, flowing from chapter 3, that the adjudication and punishment of criminal guilt for offences against a law of the Commonwealth is exclusively within the province of courts, exercising the judicial power of the Commonwealth.' I'll just repeat that last bit: 'exclusively within the province of courts'.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now here's Peter Dutton trying to reach across that separation of powers and drag back to himself the capacity to impose punishment for alleged criminal behaviour, with no standard of proof established. This minister, Minister Dutton, is on a lifelong political crusade to undermine the rule of law in this country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian Greens do support the rule of law; the Australian Greens do support the separation of powers. And it is those principles that will inform the way that we vote on this matter.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">In regard to the provision of the Solicitor-General's advice, I make the blindingly obvious point that governments regularly choose to release the advice of solicitors-general when they believe it's in their political interests to do so. I've seen it many times, previously, in the Tasmanian parliament, and I've seen it here in the Commonwealth parliament. In fact, the legal professional privilege which the government seeks to rely on is something that the government is able to waive. It is their advice. They don't need the permission of the Solicitor-General to release the advice; the government can choose to release the advice, and often do when it's in their political interests to do so.</span>

                  </a>  I'll take that helpful interjection from Senator Patrick, who makes another blindingly obvious point: that this advice was actually paid for by the Australian people. It's actually their advice, not the government's, and they're entitled to see it.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At its heart, this is about allowing the Senate to have an informed debate about a bill that, on the face of it, prima facie, is unconstitutional. I'm not a lawyer, but I can read and I can listen and I know that numerous legal experts have expressed opinions that call into significant doubt the constitutionality of this legislation. We're entitled as senators in this house of review to have all the necessary information put before us by the government to allow us to have an informed debate, and we're entitled to have all the information put before us by this government that would allow every senator to make an informed decision about legislation. This government is now behaving in a secretive way and is denying us, who represent the Australian people in this place, the information that we need to do our jobs and hold the government to account. As I said, this motion will be supported by the Australian Greens.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:51</span>):  In his short contribution, Minister Cormann was keen to wipe away, or to gloss over, the substantive issues that are engaged by the motion before us. This motion goes to the separation of powers, as other speakers have pointed out. I want to quote the public remarks by the President of the Law Council, Mr Arthur Moses. He has said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">A Commonwealth law may be unconstitutional if it authorises the Executive to determine and impose punishment for criminal conduct. A ministerial decision to grant a TEO is arguably punitive, and arguably invalid. In granting a TEO, a minister is effectively determining and imposing punishment for a citizen’s alleged conduct—or prospective offence—in the form of an order preventing re-entry.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Protecting the safety and security of the Australian people must always be the paramount concern of Government. But rushed laws at risk of Constitutional challenge pose an unnecessary risk to national security. The Australian people must be able to have confidence that public safety and the work of our intelligence and law enforcement agencies is protected by laws and powers that are strong, proportional and without legal ambiguity.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That was the advice that was provided to the PJCIS and that is the advice that continues to be provided by the Law Council and other senior lawyers in this country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government has put the view that we ought to wait until the committee stage and deal with this in that debate. But the problem is that the government has shown no inclination to provide the advice that has been reportedly sought by the PJCIS and is now sought by this chamber. The government has asserted that the bill is constitutional. But who in their right mind would trust these people? The government has shown over many years that it is more than happy to play with the truth when describing its legal advice. Just ask Solicitor-General Justin Gleeson. Ask him if Senator Brandis truthfully and appropriately represented his advice to the PJCIS on the constitutionality of bills. Because he didn't; he didn't at all. He misled the PJCIS, and it places this chamber in a very difficult position because we cannot rely on the advice that is provided by government in relation to constitutionality. We cannot rely on the government to provide some sort of precis of the Solicitor-General's advice, because the government has been caught time and time again actively misleading this chamber about that very matter. And do we really think that this practice stopped when Senator Brandis left this place?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's not unprecedented for advice to be released. The Solicitor-General's advice has been released at least nine times in the past two decades. I want to reflect on what occurred in this chamber in relation to one of those occurrences. On Thursday, 17 February 2000, back in the Howard government, this chamber was considering the Ministers of State and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 2000. Senator Ellison advised the chamber that an opinion on the legislation had been sought from the Solicitor-General, and Senator Robert Ray on this side of the chamber then asked for that advice. Senator Ellison was happy to provide it. His comments in providing it are really instructive:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">… this is a matter which does not involve an individual case. It is a technical matter, not necessarily a strategic matter. It does affect all governments of all political persuasions. Therefore, on the basis that it does not set a precedent, the government does think it should be tabled …</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We're asking for the advice today on the same basis. It is an important question to assist the chamber in assessing a policy proposition that has been put before us in the form of legislation and we do not consider that providing advice would set a precedent but we do consider that on this occasion it is necessary. It would surprise no-one that the Morrison government is less committed to transparency than the Howard government was. In fact this government falls short of the Howard government in so many ways. I'll conclude by reflecting on what Senator Ray said when he was requesting that advice from Senator Ellison 19 years ago:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Governments usually table that legal advice when it is not terribly controversial and when it assists their case; they never do it if it does not assist their case.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The question for all of you is: does the legal advice that you're sitting on assist your case or not?</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:56</span>):  This morning I have been confronted with this amendment to the bill asking for the Minister for Home Affairs to provide the Solicitor-General's advice on the constitutionality of the Counter-Terrorism (Temporary Exclusion Orders) Bill 2019. I have had a briefing from the government with regard to the visa TEO and I am quite happy with it. I see this as a ploy to actually derail this whole bill from going through. We debated here in this chamber for quite some time yesterday. I am of the understanding that Senator Rex Patrick has been briefed by the government and could have asked these questions with regard to this. I have been assured that I could be given another briefing with regard to this. Decisions have to be made in this place with regard to this bill. We're talking about people coming into this country who have gone to fight against our values and our principles in other countries and have actually destroyed those countries, killed people, raped women and left children homeless. Those people wish to come back to Australia. I know the general feeling of the majority of the Australian people: they don't want them back in this country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill is about stopping these people from virtually getting on a plane and coming to Australia. They have to apply for a visa. Two years then have to pass before they can get into the country so that things can be put into place in the country to make sure that they are being watched. If you listen to the comments of the Greens, you'll hear that they're more worried about their human rights and their freedom to be able to do whatever they want to do. There was no freedom given to the people whom they murdered and whose countries they destroyed but they believe that they have the right to come here to Australia. It's in the interest of the Greens to allow this to derail it and to stop it. Constitutionally I have to rely upon the government and the Solicitor-General to actually have put in place the procedures that we need to ensure that this bill is correct.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">You, the Labor Party, put amendments forward that are just prepared to water the whole lot down. You, the Labor Party, have been so weak on border protection in this country. You are not prepared—through you, Chair. You have not done your job in protecting this country and the Australian people. I don't trust the Labor Party on border protection. You would open up the gates to allow these people in. Your amendments would do just that. They would water it down completely so that we would not be able to stop these people getting in, plus their families, plus their spouses. The people are fed up with it. People in this country are in fear about the terrorism on our streets. I am relying on the government to get this bill passed—and that this bill does comply with the Constitution and constitutionality, and that it is right to be able to pass it. I would say we need to put this in place now, and support the government on this. You're toing and froing with this, and it's just a ploy to stop it here in the parliament. I will not be supporting this motion. I want to see these people stopped from coming into the country.</span>

Indeed, in the House of Representatives, they ultimately passed this legislation completely unamended.

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="266524" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator ROBERTS</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:11</span>):  As a servant to the people of Queensland and of Australia, I rise to speak about every human's highest priority. First, I want to protect Australians from the scourge of terrorism and from those who would destroy our Australian way of life, our culture and our very existence. The aim of this bill, the Counter-Terrorism (Temporary Exclusion Orders) Bill 2019 and the related bill, is to protect us all from those who seek to destroy our culture. Security should be at the heart of what we do in this chamber. As our party leader said just a few minutes ago, the Labor Party and the Greens cannot demonstrate that. But we believe we can.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One Nation strongly supports this bill because it is aimed at complementing and strengthening our security measures and protecting Australians from the risks of imported terrorism. This bill and the related bill ensure there is no rush for those vile men and women who actively supported terrorists in the Middle East conflict in Syria—supporting ISIS, a declared terror organisation—to carry out their violent push to dominate and control innocents around them. That is core. Known for bloody, barbaric murders, rapes of women and children, and mass killings of those who could not recite passages from the Koran, these men and their deadly women supporters do not deserve in any way to be considered innocent Australians abroad. They made a conscious choice to join and support murderers whose aim is to end Western civilisation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill ensures that authorities will have a reasonable amount of time for would-be returnees to be investigated fully, to identify the risks they may pose to the personal safety and security of the Australian people, should these terrorists return. Seriously, how could a reasonable, thinking person want one of these returnees anywhere near our families? What amount of rehabilitation will ever have us believe we are safe anywhere near these terrorists, should they return? There is no way that Pauline Hanson's One Nation will support the spread of these radical beliefs in this country—no way, truly. The Greens are off the planet if they think that these terrorists or their families should be able to come waltzing Matilda back to us, back into the arms of a tolerant and naive Australian community. Should they get away with saying 'Honey, I'm home!'?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Greens have described this as a bad bill and say they will not support it. They have said that Australian citizens should not have to face the same security of conduct that non-Australian radicals would face. What rubbish! The Greens, and some in Labor, show they are anti-Australian and are thus, like terrorists, anti-human. A terrorist is a terrorist, and we do not want them here. Our view is a strong and clear one: if returnees have left Australia to fight against Australian principles, why should it be easy for them to come back—if they should come back at all?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Terrorism is a real and current threat to Australians and our way of life, and to our security. Since 2001, 73 Australians have been convicted of terrorism-related offences. Fifty of those are currently in jail. About 80 Australian men and women are currently in Syria or Iraq and have fought for or supported Islamic extremist groups. About 100 Australian terrorists received their just deserts, dying for nothing in the dust of a foreign country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There have been seven attacks and 16 major counterterrorism disruption operations in response to potential-attack planning in Australia. These figures are terrifying in light of the thousands of Australians who would have died as a result of these attacks were they not successfully foiled by our police and security personnel. Vigilance by the government is needed to protect our citizens, and strong laws are necessary to maintain the excellent success rate of Australian counterterrorism measures. Please think about this: one of the scariest statistics related to terrorism in Australia is that Australia's national terrorism threat level is at 'probable'.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Pauline Hanson's One Nation is proud to support this bill. It takes a deservedly tough stance and provides an approach that is clear that, as a country, we take the terrorist threat seriously and are prepared to provide a tough response to ensure people's security. That concern is foremost with Pauline Hanson's One Nation. Please consider these further thoughts: already, dual citizens can have their Australian citizenship revoked providing the government complies with high hurdles. That's already the case. Those who are Australian only cannot have their citizenship revoked under international convention. Although, after listening to people across our state, I know that many Australians—me among them—would like to stop these terrorists returning altogether, they are, in fact, allowed and entitled to return.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill enables our immigration and counterterrorism experts to do their job of assessing threats, with the sole purpose of protecting law-abiding Australians. The government cannot stop Australian citizens from returning, yet temporary exclusion orders can delay the return of terrorists until their threat can be adequately assessed and measures put in place to protect the security of ourselves and our families. Government has three primary roles—protecting life, protecting property and protecting freedom. This basic and practical approach has long driven Pauline Hanson's One Nation, and we commend the government for introducing this bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our opponents will claim there are human rights issues. The reality is that opponents put the rights of criminals and terrorists ahead of the rights of law-abiding Australian citizens. I say Australians and their families have a right to safety, peace, freedom and security in our own country. Our Constitution was written at a time when it was assumed that inhabitants of our country were loyal to our country. Sadly, after three decades of the Liberal-Labor duopoly relaxing immigration standards, we now have homegrown and foreign terrorists who want to destroy our country and what our country stands for. Australians who have self-selected themselves out of Australian values to fight for a barbaric political ideology will still have the right to judicial review of the minister's decision. This bill simply ensures that there is a process for managing the return of so-called Australian citizens subject to them complying with reasonable conditions to ensure our security. It is a hardline bill, and we like that. It is a hardline bill because these barbarians have, through their own behaviour and free choices, tossed aside Australian values and the values of Western civilisation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd like to take some time now to discuss the fundamentals of immigration. Having worked briefly in Mount Isa many years ago, I can proudly point to it as a success story. Immigrants from nations all over the world with values similar to and compatible with Australian values are a large part of the success of that once-remote community. Mount Isa generated and continues to generate enormous wealth for the townspeople, the North Queensland region, our state and our nation. Mount Isa proudly exports its products and its world-famous expertise worldwide. It does so because people of many backgrounds have settled and consciously and willingly chosen to assimilate and integrate, after being selected to immigrate based on their ability to assimilate and integrate and to contribute productively. Our country also has a mix of races, and we do not advocate selecting people or in any way treating people separately based on their race. Mount Isa's success was not driven on the basis of race, religion or nationality; yet tens of thousands of immigrants now call Australia home and they have settled in and do us proud. In Pauline Hanson's One Nation, we will discuss race, and we do, yet we will never proclaim one race is superior to another or deserves more than another, because we want one nation. We will never be racist, nor will we let religion decide the policies here.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But let's move on to something separate from race and separate from religion—to ideology. We cannot say that we will not segregate on the basis of ideology, because a significant proportion of immigrants in recent years have tried to change Australian life to meet their ideology and espoused behaviour that threatens this country. For example, they want to suppress women, and they do suppress women. That is not for this country. They want to force women to wear face coverings. That is not for our country. They engage in and support paedophilia, taking child brides. That is not for Australia. They want to stone homosexuals. That is not for Australia. They want to engage in female genital mutilation. That is not for Australia. They want to practise and they want to support Sharia law. That is not for Australia—one law, one nation. They want halal certification at customers' cost—our cost, the cost of everyday shoppers in Coles, Woolies, IGA and the corner store. That is not for Australia. They want to practise polygamy, and they do practise polygamy. That is not for Australia. And they want to support terrorism, and that is not for Australia. And so on.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This ideology amounts to a way of structuring society to control people using control of thought and belief. Like socialism and like communism, it is an ideology. They want to use cruel, physical punishment such as beheading, beating wives, caning, throwing people off buildings and stoning. They use fear, and that is inherent in terrorism. They are the terrorists. These practices that I just listed are contrary to Australian values and to our way of life. The entry to our country of such people pushing a barbaric ideology is the exact opposite of what made Mount Isa successful. It is the exact opposite of what made Australia successful, safe and secure. How can anyone support the entry of people pushing such ideology? Anyone advocating their entry is undermining Australian values and our way of life—undermining Australia and undermining the safety of everyday Australians.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As our party founder, Senator Pauline Hanson, says, 'We do not treat people based on their race or their religion. We put Australians first—one nation.' That is why we advocate, as part of our immigration policy, a travel ban of the type President Trump successfully implemented, preventing entry of immigrants from nations with a proven history of terrorism or violence. Yet the Greens and some elements of Labor appear to put Australia last and certainly behind their love of virtue signalling.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I must express my disgust with parts of Senator Di Natale's speech last night and his stage show—yet another Di Natale stage show with his confected rage. He's putting terrorists before Australia's security. His interest is not to protect Australians; his show is to steal Labor votes. It's standard Greens practice: fabricate a problem, create a victim, then create an oppressor, then create punishment and then, to top it off, enhance political correction to silence opposition. They label people 'racists' or 'deniers' or whatever. Why? It's simply because they lack the hard data, they lack the facts and they lack a coherent argument, and so they return to labels. Whenever we hear someone being smeared by the Greens, it confirms that they do not have an argument or facts. Sadly, as the Greens move further left, the Labor Party moves like its shadow with them. But, sadly, the Liberals then try to seek the Greens' preferences.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is the sorry tale of what passes for governance in our country. And who pays the price? It's everyday Aussies across our country. Who wins? The UN wins. Meanwhile, our vote grows because we have the guts to say what people are thinking—the truth. Failed Liberal-Labor policies on water, immigration, tax, infrastructure—trace them all to the loony, antihuman Greens and their UN masters. The pattern of fabricating problems, victims and PC is a classic UN-Soros practice.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I take this opportunity to explore the three main parts of governance—stewardship, governance itself and trusteeship. Stewardship of government assets means looking at cost of living and managing the economy properly, not the way we're seeing it being managed at the moment by making budgets to appeal to virtue signallers. Energy policy is destroying the fundamentals of our economy. On tax, multinationals are getting away scot-free. Immigration numbers are climbing out of all proportion. On security, we advocate something that Labor and Liberals need to look at: the quantity of people coming into this country needs to be cut dramatically, and the quality needs to be reassured—that is, the number and the mix of immigrants need to be properly restored. Governance, secondly, is providing for the future with a vision. That means cutting immigration numbers till our infrastructure can catch up and we get our infrastructure for water and energy. The third aspect is trusteeship of our values. This is arguably the most important of all, because culture is the most powerful determinant of productivity. Whether it be a football club, an international company, a small business or a parliament, culture is the most important determinant of productivity and prosperity, and culture is being mismanaged in this parliament.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Focusing on security involves three things. One is secure borders. Senator Pauline Hanson and I complimented the government three years ago for what they had done with our armed forces to ensure secure borders. What they have done, and what we have helped them to do, is to ensure that those borders are kept secure against the undermining of the Centre Alliance, the Labor Party and the Greens. Secondly, it involves personal security against terrorism. Thirdly, it involves economic security, and people seem to have forgotten that: energy policies, water policies, taxation policies and foreign policies.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We support immigration, at greatly reduced numbers. We want zero net immigration, and we want immigration of people consistent with Australian values and laws—people who are willing and able to assimilate and integrate, to uphold our values and our way of life. After decades of the Liberal-Labor duopoly destroying our country's productive capacity, what we in Pauline Hanson's One Nation want for Australia is a productive, safe, secure nation with its productive capacity restored. That's not too much to ask.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">At night, we don't lock our homes because we hate the people outside; we lock our homes because we love the people inside. Government's primary role is to protect the safety, property and freedom of people already inside Australia. Pauline Hanson's One Nation supports this bill, which protects constitutional rights and the primacy of safety for everyday Australians and for families. Government's primary role is to ensure security, and that is why we will be supporting this bill.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator WHISH-WILSON</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:28</span>):  I politely invite Senator Roberts and Senator Hanson to listen to my contribution this morning, which is obviously going to be quite different to theirs. I might start by talking about a piece of art, a portrait that I have hanging on my wall here in parliament. It's my own. It's not a portrait of me, but it's my own art—unlike Senator Bernardi, who I understand does have a portrait of himself in his house. But I digress. I bought it at a jeans shop for $80, and it's very special to me. It's a portrait of someone who I believe to be a great Australian man, and his name is Terry Hicks. What's also special about the portrait is that it was spray-painted by a Tasmanian artist at an Amnesty International conference in Hobart a few years ago. I bought it and put it up on my wall because Terry Hicks is a personal hero of mine. I think everybody understands he crusaded for many years to bring his son, a foreign fighter by any definition—text book definition, any broader definition—back to Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Terry Hicks was open and honest with the Australian public in his campaign to bring his son back to Australia. He said his son had been stupid, had participated in a dangerous activity, had broken the law and potentially committed crimes, and he should face the full force of the law. A man, a father's love for his son brought his son, David Hicks, back to Australia. He went through an incredibly difficult 10 years. He stood in a cage in Times Square in New York while people spat on him. He did whatever it took to highlight that his son was a human being, had made a mistake, had been highly vulnerable like a lot of young men are to the hatred and violence that's preached and radicalises young men not only in this country but all around the world. He argued to the Australian people, and successfully in the end, that his son deserved a chance at redemption, that his son deserved to come home to Australia. That's a powerful story.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Do I think that all foreign fighters want redemption and the chance of redemption? No, I don't. I think many of them want martyrdom. Do I believe that all foreign fighters should be redeemed? That is highly debatable. Do I believe that foreign fighters, if they have committed heinous, violent, criminal acts should face the full force of the law? Yes, I do. Do I believe that those kinds of people in Australia should be behind bars for our safety? Yes, I do believe that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What I question—that's fundamental to this bill—is who gets to decide whether someone gets a chance at redemption if they want to come home to Australia? Am I happy with the fact that our minister in this portfolio, Mr Peter Dutton, gets to decide who gets a chance at redemption? No, I'm not. Am I happy that a secret process that involves a minister, an often highly political environment and an intelligence agency making deliberations in a highly-secret environment get to decide who gets this chance? No, I'm not happy with that either. My colleagues have made very powerful arguments, as have other senators in this chamber, in the last 24 hours about the need for judicial oversight, separation of powers and the need to have a process that at least gives a right of appeal and doesn't hand unilateral decision-making process to a minister of the Crown. Enough has been said on that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to raise an issue that hasn't been raised in this debate so far that I think absolutely needs to be raised as a matter of public interest and that, I believe, has been an oversight. It's important in the context of what I raised about David Hicks and Terry Hicks because, when we have debated this bill in this chamber, the focus has been very clearly on foreign fighters, but if you have a look at clause 10 of this bill—making a temporary exclusion order—paragraph (2) says:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Is that definition broad enough to allow the minister to decide whether someone has citizenship rights in this country if they deem a person, an Australian citizen, to be a threat to national security? Well, I'm not a lawyer, but I have checked with legal experts and with the Australian Lawyers Alliance and their spokesperson on criminal justice, Greg Barns, and their comments were that this provision is extraordinarily broad. How might ASIO think that a person is directly or indirectly a risk to security because of some link to terrorism or concerns over politically motivated violence? What exactly does that mean? Would this clause allow a minister, under a secretive process with no recourse, total power to make deliberations about an Australian citizen overseas who may be a journalist or a whistleblower or who may be passing on secret information that they believe is in the public interest and is part of their role as a journalist? Could this interfere with press freedoms? Well, the Australian Lawyers Alliance say yes, that is what they believe. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So yet again we have another law before this parliament that allows Minister Peter Dutton extraordinary power over whistleblowers and journalists that this government—remember the political context of this—may consider to be a threat to national security. We see whistleblowers, media organisations and journalists who have published material, such as, in the very famous case of WikiLeaks, the Iraq war logs, or even the trove of materials that Edward Snowden released, which was published all around the world. Much of that work received big journalism awards for acting in the public interest. How is it that this parliament is going to pass a bill that gives those kinds of powers to a minister at a time when there are especially significant concerns in this country over what we have seen as a crackdown on press freedoms even in recent days and recent weeks, let alone lingering concerns that we have debated in previous legislation around the powers of our national security agencies? Take WikiLeaks. Does any senator in this chamber believe that ASIO, for example, may not make an adverse finding against someone in WikiLeaks or working for WikiLeaks on the basis of past history? We know that the issue that WikiLeaks is a potential threat to Australia's national security has already been raised by ASIO under previous administrations.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We had a very clear situation in the United Kingdom with David Miranda, a Brazilian national who was stopped in transit between Berlin and Rio de Janeiro after meeting a filmmaker. He had been carrying encrypted files, including an external hard drive containing 58,000 highly classified UK intelligence documents that had been released by Edward Snowden. In order to assist the journalistic activity of Greenwald, <span style="font-style:italic;">The Guardian</span> had made his travel reservations and had paid for his trip.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As it turned out, he was detained under a law in the UK that essentially labelled his activities as 'terrorist activity'. He was seized and put into detention, even though the courts agreed it was an indirect interference with press freedom. The security agencies in the UK took a journalist, seized his documents and held him in detention under a terrorism law—a new law that had been brought in that allowed them to do so. So clearly a national security agency had made a decision that a journalist carrying out their job was contrary to the UK's national interests and, indeed, was a threat to the UK's national interest.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's interesting that that same journalist was awarded a journalistic prize. Even though a Pulitzer Prize was given to Greenwald, Miranda, <span style="font-style:italic;">The Guardian</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">The Washington Post</span> for publishing the Snowden material, which revealed illegal spying and surveillance of the US and its allies in the post-9/11 world, and even though they'd won the biggest global journalistic prize in recognition for their work, they were labelled as terrorists. Acting Deputy President Farrell, you know that in this place I have queried the use of that word. I have grave concerns. I think it's one of the most misused words in the English language. It's highly subjective. It's often a real problem for the media to use that word, but throwing that word around is not a problem that politicians have. We have very strict definitions in our country as to what constitutes a terrorist activity, but, in my opinion, it is one of the most misused words in our modern dialogue.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A number of very high-profile politicians have called those journalists terrorists because they believed that the releasing of these documents had aided and abetted terrorist organisations. It's a very fine line that we deal with here, and I happen to believe that journalists going about their job in what they believe to be the public interest shouldn't be put in the firing line. We shouldn't be giving extraordinary powers to Minister Peter Dutton and our national security agency to make a determination as to whether you are an Australian citizen, have the rights of an Australian citizen and can re-enter the country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's go back to David Hicks. What underlined that campaign was that he was an Australian citizen and he had rights to come back into this country. Regardless about what you thought about what he did and the situation he found himself in, where he ended up in Guantanamo Bay, he was brought back to Australia by a conservative government, as it turned out in the end, because he was an Australian citizen and he had rights. This bill gives the ability to a minister to take away those rights. This bill gives the ability to a minister to take away the rights of whistleblowers and journalists who may simply pass on information. And it may not necessarily be about Australia's direct national interests; it may be that one of our allies requests that the information that had been passed on is not in our national interest. It's been well covered in this chamber already.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd like to raise a couple more issues in the few minutes that I have left. Firstly, I understand that we've got a lot of work that we have to do in this place. We've got some huge issues facing our country and our future, and I do question whether this bill is just part of an ongoing culture war. Yes, I do see sinister intent behind this, but I also see political intent. I see a government wanting to go out there and, straight out of the conservative rule book, flag that it's strong on national security and strong on defence, those paternal characteristics that so underpin conservative politics. As we understand from Labor's contribution yesterday, the bill's been questioned by the closed-shop, black-box joint parliamentary committee of Labor and the Liberals. It's been questioned by them. We understand the government won't be tabling advice from the Solicitor-General, which no doubt also questions the legality and constitutionality of this bill. It's been rammed through this place, and for what purpose? Well, I reckon it's for political purposes. You can argue all you like that the government needs more powers to hold foreign fighters to account—or whistleblowers or journalists to account—but it can't be done at the expense of due process. It can't be done at the expense of taking power away from the parliament and giving more power to the executive.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And I've got to say: I heard Senator Keneally's contribution in here yesterday and she provided a very detailed, very moving account of why we should be rejecting this bill. Considering all that Labor have provided in the last 24 hours about why this bill shouldn't be passed by parliament, why it should be rejected, for the life of me I don't understand why Labor would vote for this bill in the end. I get that they believe they're a party of government and there's this longstanding convention that they support each other in matters like this, but I don't accept it. That's not a good enough reason. It's actually weak. I get that they want to play small target so they're not criticised by the government's propaganda arm in some of the Murdoch publications. I get it. But it's not a good enough reason for turning your back on a very sinister piece of legislation and a new law that gives extraordinary powers to a minister and our national security agency.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I haven't heard anything from Labor—even though they might say, 'We're a party of government and we don't want to be criticised for this; we've got other things we want to focus on'—about them repealing these laws. I'm happy to be proven wrong, if they become a party of government. This is the problem: with this ratchet effect, I'm highly doubtful and very cynical that Labor, if they got into government, would claw back any of these extraordinary powers that have been given to our Border Force minister.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I stand with my colleagues the Australian Greens, Senator Patrick and others, who are the real opposition in this chamber, who are prepared to stand up and say, 'This is totally unacceptable.' We all agree that we need to work to manage the risks to our citizens. We all understand the importance of national security. But some of us understand the importance of due process and not giving too much power to the executive. I'm sorry, but I do not see the people that we have pulling the levers in this country as the kinds of people I want to give new extraordinary powers to. There must be checks and balances. There must be due process. It is simply unacceptable that we can't do our job in this place—that we can't access documents and we can't have a Senate inquiry into the kinds of processes we're seeing set up, outside the two major parties, who are a closed shop on national security and always have been. Given this day and age, with the multitude of threats and challenges we face, it needs to be opened up to the Senate and it needs to reflect what the Australian people voted for, and that is a diverse Australian Senate.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="144292" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator PATRICK</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:48</span>):  By any standards the Counter-Terrorism (Temporary Exclusion Orders) Bill 2019 is an extraordinary piece of legislation. The government's proposed law is designed to establish a temporary exclusion order, or TEO, scheme to delay Australians of counterterrorism interest from re-entering Australia until what it regards as appropriate protections are in place. In large part, the bill has been developed as a measure to prevent or otherwise control the return to Australia of Australian former Islamic State fighters and supporters from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East. This is a serious security issue and requires a serious response. But that response must be proportionate, constitutionally sound and incorporate appropriate safeguards against the arbitrary executive power consistent with our democratic society.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are two core components to the TEO scheme as set out in the bill. First, an Australian citizen who is overseas may be subject to a TEO prohibiting them from returning to Australia for up to two years at a time. The TEO can be made when the minister, the Minister for Home Affairs, suspects on reasonable grounds that the order would substantially assist in preventing terrorism related activities or if ASIO assesses the person to be a risk to security for reasons related to politically motivated violence. Entering Australia if a TEO is in force would be a criminal offence, punishable by imprisonment for two years.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The second component of the scheme, a return permit, provides that, while a TEO is in force, a person will only be able to return to Australia where a return permit is issued by the minister. So the process is: a TEO is issued, a person subject to the TEO can seek a return order, and the minister will then provide one. Under a return permit, the minister can impose conditions to control the manner in which a person subject to the TEO may return to Australia. The return permit may specify when and how the person is to return to Australia. The bill also provides that a return permit may specify conditions with which the person must comply once they return to Australia. Failure to comply with a condition will constitute a criminal offence punishable by two years imprisonment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So there's no doubt that the bill, as now before the Senate, is a very forceful security measure—an Australian citizen may be excluded from his or her own country. Under conditions set by a return permit, a person who has not been charged with any criminal offence may be subject to conditions that amount to house arrest. Like a number of other pieces of counterterrorism legislation, the bill provides the Minister for Home Affairs powers in relation to Australian citizens that would only ever be contemplated in time of war.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Centre Alliance is prepared to support the intent of the bill as a necessary security measure, but only with considerable reservation, and it is essential that the legislation, as it is before the parliament this week, be subjected to further and more rigorous scrutiny. The outcome must be absolutely sound, not only from a national security perspective but also in the proportionality of its effects. It must not give the minister arbitrary power and it must have robust constitutional and legal validity.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill was introduced into the 45th Parliament and, as senators are aware, the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security, the PJCIS, conducted an extensive review and produced a detailed report that recommended substantive changes to the legislation. The government has now reintroduced the bill with changes that implement some of the PJCIS recommendations. The government has not fully implemented all of the recommendations of the committee's bipartisan report. In some cases, where the government has indicated in-principle support in the PJCIS, its changes fall well short. In this regard, it must be clearly understood that the bill now before the parliament is qualitatively different from both the original TEO legislation considered by the PJCIS last year and from the bipartisan recommendations made by that committee.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Although, from the viewpoint of the crossbench, bipartisanship between the government and the opposition can be a double-edged sword, it is important that both the coalition and Labor work cooperatively on national security measures. This week, through the statements made by the Prime Minister and the Minister for Home Affairs, and through the government's rejection in the House of Representatives of the amendments moved by Labor to bring the bill in line with the PJCIS's recommendations, there has been a significant fraying of that bipartisan approach. This is an unfortunate development that augurs ill for consideration of national security issues in this parliament. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Certainly no-one should be rushing to pass flawed legislation, especially when the bill deals with national security and the fundamental rights of Australians. Of course, this morning during the motion to suspend I have talked of Centre Alliance's concerns in respect of the constitutionality of the bill. The PJCIS strongly recommended that the government obtain legal advice from the Solicitor-General or an equivalent legal authority on the constitutional validity of the final form of this bill. That recommendation was consistent with the committee's approach to other constitutionally uncertain counterterrorist measures. The government has accepted that recommendation but has not made any legal advice public or available to members of parliament.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I heard Senator Birmingham suggest that the release of this advice would assist terrorists. Look, if the advice is solid, in fact, it would deter terrorists from seeking to litigate. And, indeed, if this legislation is flawed or if the advice is in some way flawed, don't think for a moment that people can't just engage a very learned QC or SC, and they'll come up with the holes. So it's a bit disingenuous for Senator Birmingham to suggest that releasing this advice would be of some advantage to a terrorist. If there are shortfalls or constitutional uncertainties, let them be laid before the table and let us deal with those concerns. Let's not pass into law things that we know will end up in the High Court.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is no shortage of precedents where the government has publicly released or otherwise made available to non-government parliamentarians advice from the Solicitor-General concerning the constitutional standing of proposed laws. The government should make its legal advice available to the parliament and to the Senate and it should do so today. I note that Senator Hanson indicated that she's been briefed on that legal advice. I point out to the government that that means privilege has been waived. You can no longer claim privilege over a document whereby you have surrendered confidentiality.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While the ultimate determination of constitutional validity would rest with the High Court, the parliament is duty-bound to satisfy itself that proposed laws are constitutional, and the government is duty-bound to share that advice concerning what are, I repeat, by any standards extraordinary legislative measures. Among the other significant departures from the PJCIS's recommendations, the government has not accepted the PJCIS's recommendation that the minister must not make a temporary exclusion order in respect of a person unless the minister reasonably suspects that the person is or has been involved in terrorism-related activities outside Australia and making the order would substantially assist in preventing the provision, support or facilitation of a terrorist act. That would be, in my view, a more appropriate threshold for the exercise of the power contained in this bill. Yet, as the bill presently stands, the mere existence of adverse ASIO security advice could allow the Minister for Home Affairs to rubber-stamp a TEO.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Secret intelligence, it should be noted, is very far from being infallible. ASIO is by and large a professional organisation, but mistakes do take place. Reliance on flawed, incorrect or fabricated information can have serious consequences and can give rise to serious injustice—the scandal around the detention of Dr Mohamed Haneef being but one example. The government has also not accepted the PJCIS's recommendation that the issuing authority for a TEO should be a judge, retired judge or senior AAT member. Instead, the bill proposes that the minister make the decision to issue the TEO, and then his decision is subject to a very narrowly defined review process by a judge, retired judge or senior AAT member. In this regard, it is important to note the observations of the Law Council yesterday. Mr Moses made this point:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">A Commonwealth law may be unconstitutional if it authorises the Executive to determine and impose punishment for criminal conduct. A ministerial decision to grant a TEO is arguably punitive, and arguably invalid. In granting a TEO, a minister is effectively determining and imposing punishment for a citizen’s alleged conduct – or prospective offence - in the form of an order preventing re-entry. If such an order is to be made to exclude an Australian citizen from entering Australia, it is the Law Council’s view it should be made by a court, not a Minister.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government's review authority is also deeply problematic in many other ways. It will not necessarily be able to examine the full scope of ASIO material available to the minister and, indeed, may effectively be denied access to the material. This is a funny thing about our system: the person that would be asked to review the minister's decision will have to have a security clearance. The minister can decide not to pass information on if it's not in the public interest to do so, yet the minister doesn't have a security clearance. It's a crazy situation that we have in our current regime, and I have a bill before the parliament trying to rectify that.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The review authority may amount to little more than a rubber stamp process for the minister's decision, and it raises its own constitutional issues, in addition to those raised by the TEO scheme as a whole. If we look at section 30 of the bill—I read it out before—it says that it's in the event that this law is not valid. The government know that there's a problem here; they put a provision in the bill in the event that it's unconstitutional. Let's stop and make provisions that prevent that unconstitutionality. In effect, the bill, as now presented to the parliament, could result in the Minister for Home Affair rubberstamping an exclusion order and another reviewer or authority just rubberstamping his decisions.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">At every level, this legislation requires much further scrutiny. The bill, as now constructed by the government, should be referred back to the PJCIS for further detailed examination. This approach is strongly supported by the Law Council, which said yesterday:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">When it comes to matters of national security, Parliament must take the time to get laws right. That is why we are calling on the Senate to send it back to the PJCIS for further scrutiny.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We also need to look again at the question of the parliament's oversight of ASIO and other parts of the Australian intelligence community. Time and time again, the government has asked the parliament to give them new national security powers—many of them exercised in secret. Home affairs minister, Peter Dutton, and his security portfolio agency now exercise an array of powers greater than any of those exercised by any government since the national emergency of the Second World War.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">However, parliament must not merely hand over power to the executive. Parliament must play its role in the scrutiny of our intelligence agencies, and we must end the self-imposed restriction on parliament's scrutiny of the operational performance of our intelligence and national security agencies. At present the PJCIS's role is limited to considering matters of finance and administration, and is explicitly prohibited from reviewing operational performance. This limitation is in contrast to parliamentary oversight in the other Five Eyes countries—the United States, the United Kingdom, New Zealand and Canada. Centre Alliance has sought to remedy this deficiency through its Intelligence Services Amendment (Enhanced Parliamentary Oversight of Intelligence Agencies) Bill 2018, and I have circulated amendments to the Counter-Terrorism (Temporary Exclusion Orders) (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2019 that, again, seek to expand the role of the PJCIS in a way closely modelled on the Canadian oversight arrangements.</span>

                    </a>  No, I'm just foreshadowing a second reading amendment. The government has demanded that the Senate pass this legislation this week. The opposition has spoken out loudly about the flaws of the bill, the government's refusal to adopt all of the PJCIS's recommendations and the importance of bipartisanship in national security policy. The government has refused to engage and has said, 'Take it or leave it.' As I've said, no-one should be rushing to pass this legislation, especially when the bill deals with national security and the fundamental rights of Australian citizens. The PJCIS should do its job and review the legislation again, and the Senate should do its job properly as well.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor should do its job and not just talk and pontificate but oppose measures that they have said are flawed, likely unconstitutional and, consequently, unlikely to properly support national security. I seem to recall, when we were talking about the media raids, Mr Albanese saying to the media that no longer would the Labor Party just tick and flick legislation. They know there are problems with this bill, yet they're going to tick and flick it. They know there are problems; I listened to Senator Keneally's speech. We'll be supporting their amendments because they seek to rectify the bill. And, if those amendments are successful, we will support the bill.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I get what we're trying to do here. We're trying to stop those bad eggs getting to Australia and causing security issues. What Centre Alliance is concerned about is the innocent person who might just happened to have been in Jordan doing some work with a mission and happened to be photographed in a bar—probably not a bar, there, but in a place or at an event—where there might be people who are bad eggs. That photograph is then presented to the minister. That person may be completely innocent but the way it works at the moment is that the minister can make a determination and that determination gets reviewed, but not on the merits. There's no challenge to whether or not the photograph is correct. The review authority simply says, 'Did the minister make his decision informed by an ASIO brief?' That means that that very innocent citizen is now in a position where, in order to challenge the TEO, in order to challenge the re-entry permit conditions, they have to take the matter to the Federal Court or the High Court, at great expense.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In every other scenario where we have the executive making a decision, we give them an avenue like the AAT so they can present their position. There's not even a chance for the person subject to the TEO to put up a case and say, 'That photograph was taken, but I don't even know these people.' That's the problem that Centre Alliance has. It's not about the way in which you're trying to stop bad eggs getting to Australia and making sure we control them if they're Australian citizens; it's about protecting the innocent people. As such, we won't be supporting the bill. We will be abstaining unless the amendments Labor have moved are passed.</span>

Senator Patrick just called this an extraordinary bill, and I agree with him. It is extraordinary for very good reasons. This hasn't been a rushed bill. It is balanced, and it is required now.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Around 230 Australians have travelled to Syria and Iraq to fight in the name of ISIL since 2012. Though many have died in fighting, many of those who survive intend to return to Australia, a country whose values and way of life—and responsibilities as citizens—they have rejected. Indeed, the advice of our national security agencies is that, following the recent collapse of the Islamic State's territorial control in Syria and Iraq, many of these people will be seeking to return to Australia in the very near future. Their return, and the significant risks they pose, must be carefully managed. It must be controlled in the interests of all Australians and our national security.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As we already know, the threat beyond our shores is also resident here in Australia. Since 12 September 2014, when the national terrorism level was raised, our police and security agencies have thwarted 16 terrorist attacks right here in Australia. It is against this backdrop, and on the advice of our intelligence and law enforcement agencies, that the government has introduced the temporary exclusion orders bill and advocates for its urgent passage. Keeping Australian communities safe from those who seek to do us harm is, and will always continue to be, this government's No. 1 priority. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But let us be very clear who we are talking about to be the subject of this legislation. These are not Australians who have taken themselves and their families on a war zone, a conflict zone, Contiki tour. These are Australian citizens who have enjoyed the rights of, and also the responsibilities accorded by, Australian citizenship: the right to live in a free and open society free from fear. These people have now come to the attention of counterterrorism interest. Why? It is because they travelled to Syria and Iraq. Maybe, in a few cases, they went unknowingly, but many actively went to support the work of ISIS—a terrorist organisation that has inflicted rape, torture and death on innocent people in both Iraq and Syria, an organisation that sought to subjugate people to the tyranny through force of arms. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Some of these people even took their own children with them to be trained to hate, to become martyrs, to become murderers, to become jihadi, and they raised their children under the ideology of terrorism and hate—the so-called 'cubs of the caliphate'. Now they want to return to Australia to benefit, once again, from the rights of being an Australian citizen. I'd ask all in this place: are you comfortable with having these Australians returning to Australia uncontrolled and unsupervised? We have to make sure, as much as we can, that they are safe to live next door to you or your constituents and that it is safe for their children to go to school with your children. Our view is that we must have formal controls in place to manage their return and allow Australian authorities the time they need to gather any outstanding evidence and to finalise any prosecution that may be required. This is why we are introducing these temporary exclusion orders—to keep Australian communities safe. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There have been many claims made in this debate by those opposite. They undoubtedly will be raised again when we go into committee, so I'll leave the rebuttal of those issues until that point. But I would make these two points. There's been a lot of discussion in the chamber that these are unfettered rights—and, again, there's been a lot of demonisation of the Minister for Home Affairs. Any cursory read of this bill would demonstrate that what they have said is patently untrue. All decisions by the home affairs minister to make a TEO are subject to administrative review before the TEO can be put in force, and they are subject to judicial review as well. So that first claim by those opposite is patently untrue and fearmongering. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The second issue that we've debated and discussed at some length today is about the release of the Solicitor-General's advice. I'd say two things in relation to that. Firstly, as has been pointed out, this government will never, ever release information that would be patently of use to terrorists and their own lawyers. That, simply, is something we would never support. Secondly, we did seek that advice at the recommendation of the Law Council of Australia and the Human Rights Commission. I understand they are happy with the fact that we did that. They asked it and we did that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In conclusion, I'd like to acknowledge the significant work in this regard on this bill by the ministry of home affairs, ASIO, the AFP and the Office of Parliamentary Counsel. I thank also my colleagues for their debate and consideration. It's for these reasons that I commend these two bills to the Senate.</span>

Can you firstly clarify that those opportunities do not extend to reviews of the merits of the minister's decision? Secondly, can you confirm that they are limited to the making of a TEO and not other aspects of this legislation—for example, varying the provisions of a TEO?</span>

We can sit here till the cows come home, as far as I'm concerned, so I'll just ask the question again and I hope you can actually answer it, rather than answering a completely different question that, with respect, you weren't asked. Is the decision of a minister to issue a temporary exclusion order able to be reviewed judicially based on the merits of the minister's decision—yes or no?</span>

It's clear that, when the minister makes a TEO, it's passed pretty much on the same day to a reviewing authority, which is not a court. My question firstly is: in that initial stage, where the reviewing authority looks at it, can the reviewing authority look at it on the basis of the merits? And, secondly, can you confirm that there is an option available to someone to seek judicial review in the Federal Court or the High Court in respect of the TEO, irrespective of the review by the reviewing authority?</span>

If your question is, 'Can the reviewing authority review the length or conditions of a TEO?' they can. The administrative review is of the lawfulness of the minister's decision. That is done by the reviewing authority before it becomes lawful.</span>

The minister is presented with some information by ASIO that suggests that someone is a security risk or someone might be involved in terrorist activities if they were to return to Australia. On the basis of that advice from ASIO, the minister makes a decision. The question is: when the decision is then handed to the reviewing authority, is the reviewing authority able to look at those same reasons and perhaps overturn the decision on the basis of something that he or she thinks is flawed?</span>

In case you haven't had the opportunity to read the EM and the accompanying material, I'll tell you what the test for the reviewing officer considers. The reviewing authority decides if any of the following apply: it was an improper exercise of the power to make the TEO, the decision was induced or affected by fraud, or, if the decision was made under section 10(2)(a), whether the minister could have formed the required state of mind based on the information considered by the minister. So, again, it is quite comprehensive and freely available for your perusal in the EM and other documents.</span>

But, in relation to the exclusion of the ADJR Act review, this is necessary, as I have said a couple of times already, due to the need for speed in relation to this. So the further judicial review by the Federal Court or the High Court can take a merits based approach and also consider the decision of the administrative review, giving regard to the broader circumstances that you're talking about.</span>

I'm asking you to once again confirm that the judicial review opportunities that are available, according to the paperwork attached to this bill under section 75(v) of the Constitution and 39B of the Judiciary Act, do provide for a merits review of an appeal based on the merits of the minister's decision. I think we need to be really clear about this, so I hope my question is clear. I'll say it again while I know your advisors are communicating with you. My question is: under the judicial review opportunities available under section 75(v) of the Constitution and section 39B of the Judiciary Act, is it possible under both of those provisions or either of those provisions to ask the courts to review the minister's decision based on the merits of that decision, as opposed to based on the question of whether or not the minister has obeyed the law in making that decision?</span>

So you have confirmed that it allows for a review based on the legality of the decision. I understand that but that is not my question. Does it provide for a review based on the merits of the minister's decision? Yes or no, Minister? Yes or no? You keep getting up and saying that it provides for a review based on the legality of the decision. There is no question in my mind and I presume in the minds of any other senator about that. The question in my mind is: do those provisions in section 75(v) of the Constitution and/or section 39B of the Judiciary Act provide for an appeal against the minister's decision based on the merits of the minister's decision, as opposed to the legality of the minister's decision? Could you please just say yes or no to that question?</span>

In reference to the TEO, the minister makes a decision based on what has been presented to him by the individual departments. He then makes a TEO against these people who may wish at some time to come back to Australia. In doing so—the minister may clarify this if I'm incorrect in my assessment—the minister will actually sign off on the names put before him and, once he has done that, then the reviewing officer, which is usually a retired judge or a former judge of the AAT, will actually have a look at it to make sure that the legalities are adhered to.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator McKIM</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:47</span>):  Here we go again. The ongoing march towards a police state is alive and well in this place. Again, for legislation, including some that we're currently debating—the temporary exclusion order regime—which sets up Minister Dutton or any future Minister for Home Affairs as judge and jury, and which undermines the rule of law in this country, the Senate is being prevented by the government from conducting an inquiry into that legislation and the consequential amendment legislation which is attached to it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Again, with the sunsetting of powers legislation, I want to place on the record that what that legislation does is to extend a previously agreed-to sunsetting of the power of the government to throw someone in the slammer for up to a week without charging them. What the government are doing here is absolutely outrageous. They're preventing the Senate from doing its job, they're preventing transparency and they're jamming through draconian legislation that marches us yet further down the road to a police state, yet further down the road to a surveillance state and yet further down the road to an authoritarian state.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When will you people ever be happy? When you pass laws saying we can't get out of the bed in the morning because we might slip over? Seriously, this is a debate about the balance between freedoms and liberties on one hand and making our community safer on the other hand, and you don't want to let the Senate have that debate properly. You just want to jam this stuff through because it suits your short-term political agenda to do so. Well, as I said yesterday, the Australian Greens are not going to lie down on this stuff, because someone has to come in here and fight for freedoms and liberties as so many Australian Defence Force personnel, including family members of mine, have done for so many decades in this country. Tragically, many of them, including at least one of my immediate family, have died to defend these freedoms and liberties that you come in here and give away and prevent the Senate from scrutinising adequately.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm going to use the f-word again: you're a bunch of fascists. You're a bunch of fascists in this place. You torture innocent people in offshore prisons. That's been going on for six years. You trample over the fundamental rights and freedoms of Australians. You're turning this country into a police state. I'm warning you that the social contract between the people and the parliament is becoming ever more strained, and it's because you are removing rights without adequate scrutiny. It's because you won't take strong action on the climate emergency. It's because of massive wealth and wage inequality in this country. If you look at the collapse of civilisations throughout human history, there are two common factors: environmental degradation and massive wealth inequality. Well, hello! Welcome to the 21st century! You ignore the diminishing of the social contract that underpins law and order in this country at your peril. Ignore it at your peril. Civil disobedience will now rise and continue to rise. While you guys are all rich and wealthy enough to avoid the personal consequences of it, there are many Australians who are not so lucky.</span>

This is a motion to refer the allegations against Mr Taylor and Mr Frydenberg to a committee for investigation into actions which are corrupt, because it is corrupt to have a minister approach his cabinet colleague in relation to his own private interests, for him to get special treatment—whatever people think about the legislative framework—in relation to an investigation into him, which is not offered to any other landholder—not offered to anybody else—but which he gets because he picks up the phone to his mate. This deserves to be investigated, and the government are seeking to prevent a postponement of this motion because they want to vote it down. Well, can I be very clear—</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Senator WONG:</span>
                  </a>  Thank you, Mr President. Well I invite you to tell me which other cabinet minister rings up one of their cabinet mates and says, 'You know this regulation you've got, well it's causing me a problem in relation to one of my properties. Can we please have a meeting with the department and also the compliance officer who might be engaged in the investigation and make sure it's all fixed up?' Who's done that? Senator Sinodinos wouldn't ever do that! Senator Ruston? She has a view about water licences. I can't imagine her ringing up and saying, 'I've got a problem with this water licence. I don't like that fact that the water prices have increased.' That's what he's done. It is extraordinary the lengths this government is going this week to protect a frankly very weak cabinet minister, but that's by the by. It's extraordinary, the lengths they've gone to make sure that the facts don't come out, that he doesn't have to answer questions. We saw in question time the Minister representing the Minister for the Environment, Senator Birmingham, very carefully saying, 'I am advised'—just a gentle side-shuffle; leave enough room. I think we all know why. It's because they're not sure he has done the right thing. They're defending him, but they're not sure he's done the right thing, because it absolutely does not pass the pub test.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's remind everybody of the facts. We know these from freedom of information documents. What they reveal is a gross misuse of public office. Following representations by Minister Taylor, Minister Frydenberg's office in his then capacity arranged a meeting between Minister Taylor, Minister Frydenberg's office and members of the Department of the Environment and Energy to discuss a listing which affected Minister Taylor's private landholdings. Let's just do that again. Minister Taylor communicates with Minister Frydenberg's office and a meeting is arranged between Mr Taylor, Mr Frydenberg's advisers and the department in relation to Minister Taylor's private landholdings. How many other landowners got that kind of special treatment? Who can ring up the then minister for the environment and go, 'Oh, I've got a problem. Could I have a meeting with the department?' He only got that treatment because he was a cabinet minister. That's the truth. And that is what is corrupt. Whether or not he got a benefit, whether or not it made money or didn't make money, whether or not there were any financial implications is actually not the key point. I don't know. The point is that it is a misuse of public office as a cabinet minister to ask for treatment from a colleague in relation to a general policy proposition that is not available to everybody else. That is not about public interest but is about your own private interests. It is actually extraordinary that people who are generally decent, as much as I disagree with their politics, can possibly defend this behaviour.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Another question is the scale and level of Minister Taylor's direct interest in the matters being discussed. This goes to Jam Land Pty Ltd. I saw someone on social media talking about money for jam. Jam Land Pty Ltd was the owner of the particular company. Let's be clear: Minister Taylor has a direct interest in Jam Land. He has it via another company—I think it's called Gufee Pty Ltd—which is a one-third owner of Jam Land. There is no declaration of Jam Land on his register of interests. The government's defence of Minister Taylor is that because he declared Gufee—which is another company that owns the shares in Jam Land—then that's sufficient. The whole point of declarations—the whole point—is that they go to declaration of conflict; they go to the declaration of conflict of interest. You put your register of interest in so that you disclose potential or actual conflicts of interest. How can you disclose a potential conflict of interest if you hide the fact that you actually are, via another company, an owner in the company that has the issue in terms of the property and the environmental regulation? It's just hiding behind companies. That's the government's defence: 'Oh, he declared it because he declared the other company.' That's not a standard that the public recognise.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, it's been put to me, 'Well, he didn't make any money out of it.' That's not the test. I don't know if he did or he didn't. I assume there was some impact on the value of the property or the use of the property—all of those issues can be explored—but that's not the test. The test is what is appropriate for a cabinet minister. I again go back to this: when there's been an environmental regulation imposed that affects your property, who else gets to ring up a cabinet minister in charge of a portfolio and say, 'Can I have a meeting with the department to discuss it'? It's only Minister Taylor. He's the only one. Do we really think that's the standard we expect of ministers of the Crown?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I say to the Senate: if this motion is voted against today, I will give notice that I will move precisely the same motion with one change—the date that it will be required. I'll move it again, and the crossbench can vote it down again, because I actually think Australians are entitled to expect this sort of accountability from a cabinet minister. Australians are entitled to expect that this chamber demands that accountability from cabinet ministers. We all know how little regard Australians have for our profession and for the democratic process, and we all, to varying extents, have to take responsibility for that. We certainly have to take responsibility for fixing it. One of the things is: people have to be accountable. It can't be one rule for coalition cabinet ministers and another rule for everyone else.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Senator WATERS:</span>
                  </a>  Senator Wong has just outlined the facts of this situation very well. This is exactly why the Greens moved for an explanation from Minister Cormann, which was given on Tuesday. It was a very unsatisfactory explanation; it simply said that Minister Taylor had disclosed that he had some interest in a company that he tried to claim was completely unrelated to another company. Long story short, this minister is trying to get out of complying with the law that everybody else has to comply with. He's doing so by virtue of being a cabinet minister, and phoning his friend—the Treasurer, who was the then environment minister—to try to get special treatment.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We moved for an inquiry into this gross breach of ministerial standards. We weren't going to get support for that, for reasons that I will go into soon, so the Labor Party moved for their own inquiry. We don't care whose inquiry gets up; this needs to be investigated. Sadly, what's now happened is that we see the crossbench are saying they don't want to support either inquiry. Why not? Why are Centre Alliance and One Nation running a protection racket for this government and this cabinet? What are they getting out of this? Our understanding was there was some support for perhaps one or even both of these inquiries. That's now changed, and we want to know why. There is some very serious conduct—we think it's corrupt; it's certainly a breach of the ministerial standards—that, now, the crossbench might be turning a blind eye to, presumably because this government has pressured them not to back this inquiry. We know that there were arrangements made to support the tax cuts and to perhaps investigate some gas arrangements. That's Minister Taylor's patch. What is Minister Taylor now doing? What is he threatening the crossbench—Centre Alliance and One Nation—with? What has he offered in order that they don't vote for this investigation into Minister Taylor's own potentially dodgy conduct? </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">What is our job here, as senators, and what is our job as a crossbench? The Greens want to look into this flagrant corruption. As I said, we don't mind if it's our inquiry or Labor's inquiry. We'll vote for both of them. Ours is on for a vote on Monday as well, folks, and we'll be seeking support for that. But I have not yet heard a decent reason why we shouldn't look into this issue. </span>

                  </a>  But this is exactly why we need an inquiry. With Senator Bernardi, who knows what he's going to do and where he's going to end up, but I hope that we can count on his support to look into what looks like very dodgy conduct by existing cabinet ministers. Our view is that ministers shouldn't be having a side business that makes them private profits, but our view is also that the Senate's job should enforce this ministerial standard if the Prime Minister won't. I call on the crossbench to back these inquiries. </span>

Thank you, Mr President. I would like to ask Senator Patrick to reflect on the contribution he just made in this place, because what he has done is substitute himself as judge and jury. He has said that his judgement is superior to that of the whole Senate. It is actually the job of this Senate to make these types of determinations. Senator Patrick doesn't just get to stand up here and say he's seen a letter and, therefore, it is all okay and, 'Just trust us.' <span class="HPS-MemberInterjecting" style="font-weight:bold;">This Senate should have the opportunity to move these very serious allegations of corrupt activity by a minister of the Crown to an inquiry.

Here's a crazy idea, Senator Patrick: if we had an inquiry, these things could be put out in an evidentiary way and the inquiry could come to a considered position. These are serious allegations. They should not be dealt with in such a facile manner by Senator Patrick. They should go before an inquiry. It is unbelievable that the crossbench are going to play a protection racket—that Centre Alliance are going to play a protection racket—for this government.</span>

                  </a>  I've got to say it's shocking that the government would refuse to consider this motion. This motion was deliberately framed in a way that uses the government's own language. This reflects what the government has been saying about the situation in China. I've spoken already in this chamber this week about the awful human rights abuses being committed by the Chinese government against the Uygurs and other Turkish Muslims, including some who call Australia home. I'll say it again: over one million people are being arbitrarily detained, some of them subjected to torture, with a terrifying surveillance state following every move. People are denied their rights to freedom of movement, privacy and freedom of religion, and all of this is occurring while the world watches. This was an opportunity for the government to back up some of the statements it has already made public, and it squibbed it. A statement from the Senate would have sent a powerful message to China that we don't accept the cultural genocide that is going on right now.</span>

                  </a>  I indicate at the outset that the opposition will continue on this occasion to observe the conventions in relation to formality, but, given the importance of this issue and the focus on this issue, I do wish to make a short statement in relation to Labor's views. As I have previously indicated on behalf of the opposition, we are deeply concerned by continuing reports of the mass detention and other violations of human rights of Uygurs and other Muslim minority groups in China. Labor supports the letter, co-signed by 22 countries, including Australia, at the Human Rights Council, calling on the Chinese government to uphold its own national laws and international obligations to respect human rights, including freedom of religion, and to refrain from arbitrary detention and restrictions on freedom of movement of Muslims in Xinjiang.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This week, along with my colleagues Senator Keneally and Mr Dreyfus, I met with members of the Uygur Australian community. Their situation is heartbreaking, and some of it has been in the public arena. No Australian could help but be moved by their circumstances. We have raised our concerns in a number of statements and public comments. We fully support the government in its efforts to raise the issue of Uygur Australians with their counterparts in Beijing and to secure consular access for any Australian citizens detained.</span>

                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This Bill is the second piece of legislation that delivers on the Morrison Government's commitment to review and reform our intellectual property system.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The intellectual property system — or IP system — is an important part of the economy. It encourages the development of new technologies, products and markets. In 2016 the Productivity Commission undertook a comprehensive review of Australia's IP system, including copyright, trade marks, patents, designs and plant breeder's rights. We asked the Commission to make recommendations to ensure that the IP system continues to provide incentives for innovation and investment. The IP system should do so without unreasonably impeding competition and access to goods and services.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government responded to the Commission's recommendations on 25 August 2017, and within a year the first tranche of reforms received Royal Assent. These changes were supported by the opposition, and updated the trade mark and the plant breeder's rights systems.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This second tranche of reforms updates the patent system. The Productivity Commission stated that its proposed reforms are intended to rebalance the patent system to take more account of the benefits to the broader community and ensure that all Australians benefit from the system.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">These reforms have been complex to develop, so the government has taken additional time to consult extensively, giving stakeholders several opportunities to provide feedback and express their views. The government has listened and is confident that the amendments strike the right balance between the needs of inventors, users of technology and the general public.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Schedule one to this Bill will amend the Patents Act. It gives effect to the recommendations made by the Commission, by introducing a statement of the objectives of the Patents Act and phasing out Australia's second-tier patent.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Part one introduces an objects clause into the Patents Act. The objects clause provides a general statement of principle about the purpose of the Act. This will make it clear what Australians want from their patent system, specifically a system that promotes economic wellbeing through technological innovation and the transfer and dissemination of technology. This will ensure that the patent system remains adaptable and fit-for-purpose as new technologies are developed in the future.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Part two begins the phasing out of the innovation patent system. This second-tier patent was intended to incentivise small to medium-sized Australian businesses to invest in research when it was introduced in 2001.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">However, in the 18 years since then, it has become clear that the second-tier patent has been more harmful than helpful for SMEs. There is widespread agreement among stakeholders that the system is not fit-for-purpose. Some people argue that the second-tier patent should be reformed, but there is no agreement on a workable alternative.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Both the Productivity Commission and the former Advisory Council on IP recommended that the innovation patent system be abolished. Both found there is no evidence that the second-tier patent stimulates innovation or research in Australia. What it does do, according to both bodies, is lead to uncertainty, confusion and a higher regulatory burden, particularly for our Australian SMEs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill will amend the Patents Act to prevent the filing of new applications for innovation patents. The amendments ensure that existing rights, filed before commencement, are maintained and protected, ensuring a balanced phasing out.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Schedules two, three and four implement recommendations made by the Commission in its 2013 report into the compulsory licensing of patents. These changes will improve the balance between the rights of IP owners and the interests of the public, bringing greater clarity and certainty to the legislation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Schedule two improves the transparency and accountability for Crown use of patented technology. There is some uncertainty about when Crown use can be invoked at the present, and this Bill makes it clear that while it is rarely used, it can be invoked when any Australian Federal, State or Territory government has the primary responsibility for providing or funding a service. This ensures that Crown use can cover the full range of services that the public expects our Government to provide.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Schedule two also protects the rights of patent holders, by improving accountability for Crown use as well as providing more guidance for determining the remuneration to be paid to the patent owner. Government agencies will be required to seek to negotiate with the patent owner and to obtain the authorisation of the relevant Minister before invoking Crown use. At the Commonwealth level, the relevant Minister is the Minister responsible for administering the Patents Act, and at the State and Territory level, it is the Attorney-General. This will ensure that Crown use is only used in appropriate circumstances.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Schedule three will make the same amendments to the Crown use provisions in the Designs Act. Crown use will then operate in the same way for both patents and designs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Schedule four improves the clarity and certainty for compulsory licensing of patents. It requires the courts to consider whether it is in the public interest to grant a compulsory licence. There was concern that the previous test had the potential to protect the interests of a particular industry, at a net cost to the broader community. The new test will ensure that compulsory licences are only granted when there will be an overall net benefit to the Australian community.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Schedule four will also clarify the process for compulsory licensing of inventions that build and improve on a previous patent.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The remaining schedules to the Bill make minor technical amendments that will streamline procedures and improve the efficiency of the IP system, ensuring the system is fit for purpose and keeps up with today's accelerated pace of technological change.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">I am very pleased to introduce this Bill, which builds on a broad consultation and enhances Australia's IP system, supporting innovation, creativity and business growth in this country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="text-align:center;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">
                    <span style="font-style:italic;" />The Tertiary Education Quality and Standards Agency Amendment Bill 2019 amends the <span style="font-style:italic;">Tertiary Education Quality and Standards Agency Act 2011 </span>(TEQSA Act) to give effect to the Government's decision to implement recommendations arising from the <span style="font-style:italic;">Review of the impact of the TEQSA Act on the higher education sector.</span></span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This review was conducted in line with section 203 of the TEQSA Act, which required that the Minister, before 1 January 2016, cause a review to be started of the impact on the higher education sector of the TEQSA Act.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In December 2015, terms of reference for the review were determined, with Deloitte Access Economics engaged to undertake the review between July 2016 and March 2017. The review was a substantial body of work: 36 written submissions were received, 33 stakeholders were interviewed, and the TEQSA Act was extensively analysed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Overall, the review was positive about the establishment of TEQSA as the national regulator in 2012, noting that the TEQSA Act is broadly operating effectively and as intended.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The review noted that the higher education sector's views regarding the regulatory system established by the Act, and TEQSA as the regulator, are positive.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The sector sees in TEQSA a regulator that is seeking to reduce the burden imposed by its activities, tailoring its requirements to meet individual features of providers and engaging more fully with the sector. The review therefore did not recommend changes that would significantly alter the regulatory framework or the role of TEQSA as the independent national higher education regulator.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The recommendations made by the review are largely technical in nature. They are designed to place TEQSA and the regulatory and quality assurance system established by the act on a stronger footing. This Bill gives effect to the review recommendations that require amendments to the TEQSA Act.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The measures contained in this Bill will improve the already effective and efficient higher education regulatory system, enabling the sector to continue its focus on delivering the highest quality teaching, learning and research, maximising the quality of educational outcomes for students and protecting Australia's international higher education reputation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill simplifies the legislative framing of the Higher Education Standards Framework by removing references from the TEQSA Act to specific categories of non-threshold standards that have never been made and are not needed. The capacity to make additional standards will be retained, however, if the need ever arises.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  <span class="HPS-Small">There are amendments made in relation to the Higher Education Standards Panel. The Bill will expand the skill set that the minister must ensure is encompassed by panel members so that, collectively, the panel has contemporary experience in the provision of higher education by both university and non-university providers. This amendment is important for the panel's oversight and advisory roles, ensuring its advice is balanced and reflects a collective understanding of issues relevant to different provider types.</span>

This amendment will improve TEQSA's capacity to respond appropriately to complainants, facilitating better engagement between TEQSA and students of higher education providers.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">This Bill amends the <span style="font-style:italic;">National Disability Insurance Scheme Act 2013 </span>to introduce streamlined governance arrangements that will simplify rule-making and decision-making under the NDIS Act.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill makes important provisions that will give the Commonwealth Minister responsible for the National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS) increased certainty about timing of decisions under the Act requiring state and territory agreement, including appointments and terminations to the Board of the National Disability Insurance Agency (NDIA) and the NDIS Independent Advisory Council, and the making or amending of some NDIS Rules. The Bill also ensures the states and territories will continue to have an essential and strong role in the stewardship of the Scheme.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">These administrative amendments will ensure the governance arrangements that underpin the NDIS are efficient and effective, building on the recommendations from an independent review of the Act in 2015, the Productivity Commission inquiry into NDIS costs in 2017 and intergovernmental agreements supported by the Council of Australian Governments (COAG).</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The NDIS is one of the largest social and economic policy reforms in Australia's history.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Difficulties with the current governance arrangements have been consistently The Scheme is continuing to grow at a rapid pace as it rolls out across the country. Over 300,000 Australians are currently receiving support through the NDIS and around 100,000 of these people are receiving support for the very first time. The vision of the NDIS, to enable every Australian with a significant and permanent disability to access the reasonable and necessary support they need to participate fully in their communities, is progressively being realised.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Since 1 July 2019, the NDIS has been available across the continent. The Scheme will continue to grow at a rapid pace over the next few years — with around 500,000 participants estimated to benefit from the NDIS over the next five years.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This government has been fully committed to the NDIS from day one. We are bringing forward this Bill to establish streamlined governance arrangements to ensure the governance structure that underpins the NDIS is effective, efficient and adaptive.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The NDIS is a significantly complex reform, with governance shared between the Commonwealth and state and territory governments. The current NDIS governance structure includes a legislative framework, the NDIA Board, the NDIS Independent Advisory Council and the COAG Disability Reform Council (DRC). Each body plays an important role in assuring that the NDIS remains true to its objectives.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Under current legislative and governance settings, the states and territories have significant roles and responsibilities in NDIS policy and funding arrangements. Setting and amending NDIS Rules, the giving of directions to the CEO and NDIA Board as well as making appointments and terminations, generally requires unanimous agreement from all jurisdictions. This has resulted in a governance structure that is complex, with decision-making processes being more time-consuming and less efficient than required for such a significant reform.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">identified during the NDIS trial and transition periods. Past experience of the requirement to obtain unanimous agreement from all states and territories has meant NDIS Rules, or amendment to Rules, which have agreement at the officials' level, have taken up to ten months to be formally agreed before they could be registered.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">
                    <span style="font-style:italic;" />Unnecessary delays in decision-making was recognised as a critical issue by the Productivity Commission in its 2017 Review of NDIS Costs. In the PC's final report, handed down in October 2017, while acknowledging the complexity of shared governance arrangements and the valuable knowledge and expertise of all governments for designing and refining the Scheme, the PC concluded that <span style="font-style:italic;">­</span><span style="font-style:italic;">"</span><span style="font-style:italic;">such timeframes for decision making could pose significant operational difficulties for the NDIA </span><span style="font-style:italic;">"</span><span style="font-style:italic;">.</span></span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The shared governance arrangement requiring unanimous agreement from states and territories to progress a large range of critical issues is indeed cumbersome and complicated. This reduces the Commonwealth's ability to respond rapidly and flexibly to emerging issues.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This government, along with states and territories, has therefore reached the view that better arrangements are required as the NDIS approaches full scheme. Changes will improve the effectiveness of governance arrangements to provide an agile and responsive legislative environment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This is good news for Australians living with significant and permanent disability, their families and carers who are set to benefit from the NDIS. These changes will simplify what is a complicated and inefficient system of decision-making.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The changes proposed by this government include introducing a 28 day consultation process with state and territory disability ministers on matters under the NDIS Act that require agreement. If they do not respond after 28 days, they will be taken to have agreed. All state and territory disability ministers have been consulted and have been voluntarily following the 28 day convention since November 2017. Formalising this commitment in law provides the right incentives for all governments to manage the NDIS efficiently.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The changes proposed by this government also establish arrangements for the Commonwealth Minister to be able to appoint members to the NDIA Board based on majority agreement of the states and territories, instead of under the current requirement for unanimous agreement.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The NDIA Board is responsible for overseeing the implementation of the NDIS and its long-term sustainability. The Board manages the financial and delivery risk of the scheme, including maintaining an actuarial and insurance approach to decision making. The Board develops the NDIA's business strategies, manages risks to the organisation and the NDIS, and through its Chief Executive Officer, handles the day-to-day management of the NDIA.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The NDIA Board is a national board, not a representative board. Members are appointed to the Board if they have the right skills and expertise to carefully mange the significant scale, cost and potential risk in delivering the NDIS ­without regard to where they live.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Allowing the Minister to appoint Board members based on majority agreement will ensure that the best and majority supported candidates are appointed in instances where there is not unanimous agreement.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The changes proposed by this government also establish arrangements for the Commonwealth Minister to be able to appoint members to the NDIS Independent Advisory Council, based on consultation with states and territories.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The function of the Advisory Council is to provide the Board with independent advice, which the Board must consider when performing its duties, having regard to the role of families, carers and other significant persons in the lives of people with disability.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">And finally, the changes proposed by this government also establish new arrangements for consultation with states and territories relating to any proposed changes to some NDIS rules — namely, those Rules that relate to the payment of NDIS amounts and the NDIA CEO's power to disclose information. These are consequential amendments that will have no impact on the Scheme's purpose or design, people's access to the NDIS, the determination of participant's reasonable and necessary supports, or the content of their plans.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The NDIS, and its beneficiaries, deserve the best and most efficient governance arrangements possible. The changes proposed in this Bill will help us deliver this world-leading reform.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Morrison Government is committed to working with states and territories and the NDIA to deliver a fully funded, high quality NDIS. This bill represents a significant step forward, cutting red tape, and ensuring governance arrangements for the NDIS enable responsive delivery and agile decision-making as we move into full Scheme.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">GREAT AUSTRALIAN BIGHT ENVIRONMENT PROTECTION BILL 2019</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">When I first introduced a bill to protect the Great Australian Bight back in 2016, the company that wanted to drill for oil in the Great Australian Bight was BP. Then it was Chevron. Now it is the Norwegian company Equinor, formerly known as Statoil.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Great Australian Bight is one of the world's great wilderness areas. It is home to a huge array of marine and bird life, marine plants and invertebrates. Eighty-five percent of species found in the Bight are endemic, found only in the Bight. It is an essential calving sanctuary for southern right whales, and a feeding ground for threatened sea lions, sharks, tuna and migratory sperm whales.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In May the UN released its latest biodiversity report. This warned that a million species face the threat of extinction. The official modelling from Big Oil companies who want to drill in the Bight indicate that a spill would impact many matters of national environmental significance. This would include up to 177 marine species, 47 species classified as vulnerable, endangered and critically endangered, and 50 coastal wetlands. Thirty-eight marine reserves would be covered in sludge, resulting in the mortality of hundreds of thousands of seabirds and thousands of marine animals, including endangered southern right whales, blue whales, killer whales, dolphins, and endemic and endangered Australian sea lions. Hundreds of sea turtles would be dead. Hundreds—potentially thousands—of kilometres of shoreline would be covered in oil, causing extreme harm to both the birds that live on the coast and those that visit nearby.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This is disastrous in itself, but it would have knock-on effects. The Bight plays host to over ten thousand fishing and tourism jobs. These industries would be decimated and may never recover. That is why, all along the coast, local councils have voted against drilling in the Bight. We know traditional owners are also opposed, horrified that their special place is under threat. And they are backed by more than two-thirds of South Australians who oppose drilling in the Great Australian Bight.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">But this is not just a South Australian problem; the same spill modelling shows oil could stretch from Port Macquarie in New South Wales to Albany, Western Australia. And, in a time of climate breakdown, what happens in the Bight affects us all.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">If we are to keep temperature rise to two degrees—and we've been told by scientists that we have to do more than that—the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report says we have to phase out fossil fuels. We cannot keep playing games with our environment and the climate. It is time to get serious about what needs to be done. We have to reduce our carbon emissions, and we have to stop the further extraction of fossil fuels that are only going to make climate change worse and more dangerous. If we are to do what the scientists say is required—keeping temperature rise to 1.5 degrees or below—there is absolutely no way we can allow the extraction of fossil fuels from the Great Australian Bight. At the volumes being proposed, we would never arrest climate change: not here in Australia and not around the rest of the world. Just a fraction of the estimated oil reserves in the Great Australian Bight would amount to three gigatonnes of CO2. This is almost equivalent to one-third of our entire carbon budget between now and 2050.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Many people—many in government—will tell you that Australia is a small player, and that we would be exporting that oil so it wouldn't affect our totals. To them I say: we are already seeing the effects of climate change and we are the last generation of policymakers and decision-makers who can do anything about it. It is up to us to make the hard decisions to reduce dangerous carbon pollution. And the more we twiddle our thumbs, and the more we deny this, the worse the problem becomes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The good people in the Bight Alliance and hardworking Australians from all walks of life have turned away BP and Chevron and are, right this moment, working to send Equinor packing. But this shouldn't be a one by one approach. The people have spoken. They do not want Big Oil, or any oil, in the Great Australian Bight. It is time for us to do our job and find a permanent way to protect this precious, important ecosystem and the climate we all depend on.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This bill does just that. During the election we saw the two major parties sit up and take notice of the Fight for the Bight. They promised 'reviews.' The time for reviews has passed; today I offer this Bill as a way to listen to the Australian people, do what is right and protect the Great Australian Bight and the future of us all.</span>

                  </a>  Over 60 organisations and 1,500 individuals who have signed a petition are calling for the government to address the significant perceived conflict of interest that commissioners Barbara Bennett and John Ryan hold in relation to their appointments as commissioners to the disability royal commission. People with a disability, their organisations and supporters have called for these two commissioners to step down and for stronger provision for all commissioners about real, perceived and potential conflicts of interest. Labor is very concerned that many individuals and advocates from the disability community have said they will not participate or give evidence if these royal commissioners remain. It is essential that people with a disability, their families and carers and their organisations have confidence in the royal commission. It's time for the government to act.</span>

                  </a>  Centre Alliance makes no disparaging remarks against the people that are involved in this, but there is a principle called apprehended bias. You'll be familiar with it in the courts. If there is a perceived conflict of interest, judges will normally recuse themselves, not because there is bias but because there's an apprehension of bias, and an innocent bystander who walks past the court must always be fully confident as to the impartiality. That's the issue here. So we will be supporting the motion, but we make no disparaging remarks against the highly qualified and esteemed people that have been named in the motion.</span>

This motion relates to their ability to do the jobs they have been appointed to, and the reality is that these two individuals are disqualified based on the conflict of interest that arises from their immediate past employment as senior bureaucrats within the very systems and processes that this commission will investigate. They do not have the confidence of the disability community, they will shortly no longer enjoy the confidence of this Senate, and the government must immediately move to replace these commissioners with folks the disability community can trust.</span>

I'm just wondering if you've had an attempt to regroup and have a bit of a think about it and maybe consult with your advisers. The question is: in regard to judicial reviews of a decision made by the minister to issue a temporary exclusion order, are those judicial reviews able to be requested on the basis of the merits of the minister's decision?</span>

Secondly, it is subject to judicial review, which is not a review of its merits but of its legality. I was very clear that the decision is not subject to merits review. My exact answer was, and I'll reconfirm what I said then: I can confirm that it is subject to administrative review before it comes into force and, secondly, that it is subject to judicial review. I clarified this further earlier by stating that allowing merits review would lengthen the decision-making process and allow a person to return to Australia without adequate notice or control of their return. Again, I believe I was very clear that the decision is not subject to merits review.</span>

It's pretty clear that the review authority, which is making an administrative review, doesn't review on the merits—I understand that to be what you said. Normally an administrative review can be appealed to a court, but, in doing so, it's normally explicitly stated in the acts that allow the referral that it is to be on a point of law only. This bill doesn't state that, so I'm wondering, when we get to the judicial stage, whether or not you can appeal on the basis of an error of law and also appeal on the basis of an error of fact?</span>

I think I have been very clear, both to you and to Senator McKim: judicial review includes a review based on an error of law. This is consistent with the Constitution, and also the Judiciary Act. There are no changes to that. In fact, these provisions are consistent with other national security legislation.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:00</span>):  I just want to put this to you, and I mentioned this in my second reading speech. What about a circumstance where a person has gone to a function somewhere in Jordan and has, in some way, been photographed with someone who really is a bad egg and that link is then made up and provided to the minister? So the minister makes the decision—in good faith—on the basis of some intelligence that says there is an association, and that matter then gets referred to the review authority. We understand from the bill that at that point there is no representation from the person subject to the TEO. They're not in a position to explain the facts of the case, which are: 'I was there on one night. I don't know these people. I've never seen them before in my life.' Of course, that can't occur, as I understand it, at the administrative review stage by the reviewing authority.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What you've just said to me is that, when we get to a court, there's no way of remedying that error. That's a question of fact—that the minister has been presented with the fact that this particular person is associated with some really bad eggs. That's a question of fact. And what you're saying is that a court could never look at that. The person who's been denied procedural fairness because the act does that is not in a position to turn up to the court and say: 'Your Honour, there's a serious error of fact in this. I can show that I've spent all of my time assisting people in Jordan who are troubled. That's how I was spending my time there. I got caught out once being in a place where there were some bad eggs.' That's what you're effectively suggesting if a court can't examine an error of fact. Using that as an example, can you just confirm that is the case?</span>

The only thing you can ever apply to a prospective law is a reasonable circumstance that will be hypothetical. There is no other way you can tease out how an act will be applied. So to somehow suggest that I should give you an example that is not hypothetical is quite disturbing. We have to explore the way in which this act will work in the future, and if I call out a scenario and you say, 'Senator Patrick, that would never happen,' I accept that. But I'm giving you a reasonable example in trying to understand how, in the future, this act would apply in those sorts of circumstances. I seek an answer to the question please, Minister.</span>

You've received a perfectly reasonable question from Senator Patrick. I'll just draw your attention to the fact that courts do look at the <span style="font-style:italic;">Hansard</span> record of debates such as these to assist them with ruling on issues that come before them, because the courts try, in some circumstances, to understand the intent of the parliament in passing legislation. When legislation is drafted, not every circumstance is foreseeable or predictable. What Senator Patrick is trying to do here is his job—his job as a senator in this house of review and his job as a senator to tease out from you, Minister Reynolds, your intent in the drafting of this legislation and, ultimately, the intent of the parliament in passing this legislation. We're trying to help the courts here, and you are hindering us in that duty.</span>

You can call it 'hypothetical' all you like, but I actually don't accept that characterisation of it. The way I would describe Senator Patrick's question is that he is asking it in an attempt to inform the Senate and to inform future potential deliberations of the judiciary, and for you to simply sit there and not answer it is not only contemptuous of the Senate, it's contemptuous of our judiciary.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These amendments to the Counter-Terrorism (Temporary Exclusion Orders) Bill ensure that the bill conforms to the unanimous and bipartisan recommendations of the Labor and government members of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security. They do no more than that and they do no less than that. Indeed, I have listened closely to the conversation between Senator Patrick, Senator McKim and Minister Reynolds and note that one of the amendments that we are moving does in fact address the very questions that Senators Patrick and McKim have been pursuing with the minister.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I do want to speak briefly to each of the recommendations of the intelligence and security committee that the government has failed to implement and set out how the amendments that I am moving seek to give effect to those recommendations. I will seek to do this as briefly as possible, noting that these are highly complex matters. The first recommendation of the committee was to amend the bill to require the minister, before making a temporary exclusion order which would require the person to either surrender their Australian passport or be prevented from applying for a new Australian passport, to have regard to, to the extent that the information is available, whether the person has a lawful ability to stay in their current location for the duration of the order; whether the person has a lawful ability to enter a third country—for example, due to holding a passport or residency visa for that third country—and the likelihood of that person being detained, mistreated or harmed if the person has no lawful ability to stay in their current location and no lawful ability to enter a third country for the duration of the order.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government say they have implemented this recommendation, but that is simply not the case. I wonder whether the government has misunderstood the committee's recommendation, because what it has done is put those considerations at the point of imposing a return permit rather than at the point of imposing the temporary exclusion order. The committee, which was chaired by Liberal member Andrew Hastie and is dominated by Liberal members, including Liberal senators, specifically recommended that these matters be considered before the minister imposed the TEO.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Why would the reasons say that these matters should be considered at the point of a return permit but not at the point of issuing a temporary exclusion order? It makes me wonder whether the government understands the difference between a temporary exclusion order and a return permit. It would be good if the government had agreed to Senator Patrick's motion earlier and, indeed, the request that I had made that this bill be referred back to the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security, because we could actually interrogate the government and officials and have an iterative process that might have allowed us to come to a better conclusion. However, the Minister for Home Affairs has simply said he won't be taking advice from this committee any longer. That is what he said in the House yesterday. It's the 'my way or the highway' approach to national security that the minister now seeks to implement. The government has claimed it has implemented the first recommendation. That is, in a very literal sense, not true. Amendment (10) would implement the committee's recommendation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The second recommendation of the committee was to amend the bill to require the minister to give a return permit to a person as soon as practicable. The committee recommended that it be as soon as practicable. The government says it has implemented recommendation No. 2. No, it has not. It has changed it to say 'within a reasonable period'. That is not the same as 'as soon as practicable'. Amendment (25) seeks to give implementation to that recommendation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Recommendations Nos 3 and 12 from the committee would have seen the bill amended to prevent the making of a temporary exclusion order unless the decision-maker:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">

                  <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">making the order would substantially assist in preventing the provision of support for, or the facilitation of, a terrorist act.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This recommendation, recommendation No. 12, would have also prevented the minister from acting as nothing more than a rubber stamp for a security assessment. These recommendations were rejected by the government. That's particularly telling, because over the last few days we've heard from the government that the targets of this bill are people who have been fighting with groups like the Islamic State group in Syria, but that directly contradicts what Home Affairs told the committee in public hearings. The department told the committee that any person who is known to have engaged in active fighting in conflict zones in Syria or Iraq or both would not be subject to a temporary exclusion order and that such a person would be allowed to come back to Australia, arrested at the airport, put on trial and held in jail. The department actually said that if an arrest warrant is out a temporary exclusion order is not required. They said that in hearings. The government has to be honest about what this bill actually does and the problem that it's seeking to address. The rejection of this particular amendment illustrates the fact that today the government has not been straightforward about those matters.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The second part of these recommendations would have prevented the minister from acting as a rubber stamp. We know that this minister gets things wrong. He got it wrong on Neil Prakash. The intelligence and security committee quite sensibly proposed an amendment that would require the minister to turn his mind to the task of issuing an exclusion order. It is disappointing that the government has sought to reject recommendation Nos 3 and 12. Amendment (10) would implement them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Recommendation No. 4 would be implemented by amendment (26). The fourth recommendation of the committee was to amend the bill so that in determining the best interest of a child before issuing a TEO—because they do apply to children as young as 14—the minister would have to take into account the child's age, maturity, sex, background, physical and mental health, the right to receive an education, and other matters. The government's approach to this would allow the minister to be wilfully blind to those matters, because it would allow the minister to say that those matters are not relevant. The committee said that those matters are relevant. It should not be for the minister to decide which matters are relevant or not relevant. Amendment (26) addresses this issue and implements that recommendation in full.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The fifth recommendation of the committee was to amend the bill to require that a temporary exclusion order set out:</span>

                <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">that the issuing authority is satisfied of the matters mentioned in section 10,</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This just simply was not implemented by the government. The bill doesn't require the order to state the grounds on which an order is made—so a person will have a TEO but they won't even know why—and nor does it require the order to set out the person's rights of review. Amendment 12 implements this recommendation in full.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Recommendation 7 is addressed by many amendments, including (10), (14), (17), (20), (22), (28) and (30). This recommendation was to amend the bill to require that a temporary exclusion order may only be issued by an issuing authority, such as a retired judge, and that the authority must approve conditions in a return permit. The government say that it has implemented this recommendation in full. The minister often says that this is just like the UK scheme. It is not just like the UK scheme; the UK scheme, in fact, is as the committee recommended. The government has created its own process, a process that is highly questionable in its constitutionality and which would in fact put this legislation in doubt as to whether it would actually be effective. Recommendation 7 is a significant recommendation. It is one that seeks to implement what the UK scheme has done, and there is no evidence that it's not working for the United Kingdom. The government hasn't given any substantive justification as to why it hasn't taken up recommendation 7, and that's why we're moving those amendments.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The 10th recommendation is a very simple one:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Committee recommends that the Bill be amended to clarify that a person may seek judicial review of a decision of the Minister to grant or refuse an application for a return permit.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Incredibly, this was rejected by the government on the grounds that it was unnecessary! The government argued that it was unnecessary to expressly provide for a judicial review in the circumstances by pointing to the fact that a minister must accept the application for a return permit.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But this is not precisely true. The minister must give a return permit if the person has applied to the minister in a prescribed form and manner, and:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… if the person is to be, or is being, deported or extradited to Australia.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Implicitly, the minister may refuse to give a return permit if he or she does not believe the person has applied in an appropriate manner or form, and the minister may or may not be correct about that. So amendment (24) makes clear that there are judicial review rights in relation to a decision to grant or refuse an application for a return permit. This is pretty basic, and it's extraordinary that the government doesn't think it needs to be included.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Recommendation 11 would be implemented by amendment (31), and would see the bill amended:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">… so that, in any prosecution for a breach of an offence provision under the Bill, the prosecution must prove that the defendant had knowledge of the existence of the temporary exclusion order or of the relevant return permit condition (as applicable).</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As a general principle, people should not be prosecuted for breaching an order they are unaware of, especially in circumstances where an order can be issued on the basis of the matters believed or satisfaction of certain matters and where the breach of order can result in a prison sentence. The government has failed to provide a coherent argument as to why that general principle should not be adhered to in these circumstances.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While it is true that a person may not be aware of an exclusion order at the time it's issued—because, perhaps, they're in a remote location or the government doesn't know where the person is—any such person who tries to return to Australia would presumably be made aware of the order when he or she tries to board a plane, for example. Is the government really saying that a person who is subject to one of these orders would not be flagged on an airline's computer system?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government has to explain why, in a practical sense, requiring the prosecution to prove actual knowledge of the existence of the order is unworkable. It is not enough just to assert that. That's what the government has done, though, in its submission to the Intelligence and Security Joint Committee, and no member of that bipartisan committee, Labor or Liberal, was convinced. That is why the committee has made recommendation 11, and amendment (31) would implement that recommendation of the committee.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So, there you have it: nine recommendations of the bipartisan Intelligence and Security Joint Committee that were not implemented by the government and which Labor's amendments would seek to implement in full. This is, as I said, a bipartisan committee of this parliament which has operated quite effectively, particularly since 2013, from when there has been a raft of significant national security legislation put before the parliament. That committee has worked quite effectively. It is chaired by a Liberal member of parliament and it is Liberal dominated. They made 18 substantive recommendations. The government, in proceeding with this legislation and proceeding with this legislation in a manner that does not allow the bill to go back to the committee, means we are forced to deal in the Senate with the issues that properly should have been dealt with by the intelligence and security committee. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I flag that Labor supports the intent of this legislation and Labor supports this legislation. I will not have this legislation go through the parliament without Labor's support, because we want a scheme. We want a scheme that works. We understand the threat that returning foreign fighters pose to the Australian community. What we want is a scheme that keeps Australians safe, that is constitutionally valid and that works. While we will support this legislation, we are moving these amendments in an effort to improve it to ensure that Australians have a scheme that they can rely on that is constitutionally valid and that will withstand a High Court challenge. It is unfortunate that the government is proceeding in this way with this legislation. </span>

The Australian Greens understand that the amendments that we're currently debating, moved by Senator Keneally, do in fact reflect the recommendations of the Joint Standing Committee on Intelligence and security. On the basis that they make a terrible piece of legislation slightly less bad, we will be supporting the amendments. But I want it placed on the record that, even should these amendments pass, we still would not support the bill. </span>

But if these amendments by the Labor Party are successful, we would in fact support the bill in the amended form. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This amendment, like the ones I just moved, seeks to give full implementation to the recommendations made by the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security on the legislation currently before the House. As I have said several times in this debate—and I make the point again—the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security is one that is dominated by Liberal members of this parliament. Labor has five members on that committee and the Liberal Party has six. A Liberal member chairs the committee.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That committee gave thorough consideration to the temporary exclusion orders legislation before the parliament, as requested by the government, and made 18 substantive recommendations. The government, for the first time since 2013, has chosen to reject in whole or in part 11 of those recommendations. In doing so, it has rejected four in whole and six in part and has ignored one entirely. We have already dealt with the one they've ignored entirely, because they are refusing to release the advice from the Solicitor-General that this legislation is constitutional. This amendment seeks to, as did the ones that we've just debated—I note the government voted against those amendments that we considered. In doing so, senators who are on the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security, such as Senators Stoker, Fawcett and Abetz, saw their own colleagues vote against their own recommendations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It may be the case that the Liberal chair of that committee, Mr Hastie, has come to a view personally that he's happy to support the government's position, but, as the chair of the committee, his responsibility would be to speak on behalf of the committee, and the committee has spoken. The committee put forward those 18 substantive recommendations, the 19th recommendation being that this bill pass the house subject to those recommendations being adopted by the government. Mr Hastie may have had a change of mind as a member of parliament, but he is also the chair of the committee. He can only speak for himself. He cannot speak for the committee. I make that point because the committee did not have the opportunity for the government's legislation that we are currently considering to come back to it, and that legislation is different. It's different to what the committee considered, it's different to what the committee has recommended and it's different to the United Kingdom's scheme that the government so frequently compares these laws to.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This amendment would seek to amend the Counter-Terrorism (Temporary Exclusion Orders) (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2019. It would seek to give effect to recommendation 16 of the Intelligence and Security Committee. This is an important one, because it goes to the notion of oversight and the ability of the committee to interrogate and understand how this legislation is being implemented. This is extraordinary legislation. The minister herself has acknowledged that. I acknowledge that. It is extraordinary legislation. It seeks to bar a citizen of the country from re-entering the country for a period of time. It requires that citizen to get a return permit from the government. When the return permit is applied for, the minister must grant it. That's something we haven't heard the government, and particularly the Minister for Home Affairs, reflect upon too often in public, but that is the fact. This bill is not so much about excluding people as it is about organising their safe return; having conditions in place to manage their safe return, to keep themselves safe and to stop them from radicalising others; and keeping Australians and the Australian community safe. That is what this bill really does.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These are extraordinary powers that we are giving to the minister. I recognise that we're in extraordinary circumstances, because foreign fighters are a new problem for countries like Australia. People have gone overseas, sometimes taking family members against their will—not to be fighters; just to be with them. Sometimes those family members get radicalised overseas. People who have gone over to be part of the so-called caliphate have sought to do Australia and Australians harm and have sought to do our allies harm. We have, as US Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, says, a responsibility to deal with our own citizens. We do have, as, of all people, President Trump said in February this year on Twitter—he tweeted that the US expects their allies to be responsible for their people. President Trump made the point that the Americans did a great deal of work, in the military sense, in seeing ISIL stopped—although it hasn't gone away. President Trump has a view that the allies of the United States should take responsibility for their people and bring them home: to face justice, to face court processes or, indeed, to face deradicalisation programs; to work to see if we can integrate people back into the community, where that's appropriate to do so; or, where they have committed a crime or crimes, to put them on trial and to see their incarceration. These are extraordinary powers, these are extraordinary times and it is extraordinarily necessary that we take these steps.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What this recommendation from the committee would do is amend the Independent National Security Legislation Monitor Act 2010 to enable the National Security Legislation Monitor to provide a copy of its reports at the same time as those reports are provided to the Prime Minister. The committee also recommended that the monitor should be empowered to brief the committee on his or her findings. That's what it does. It simply says that the Independent National Security Legislation Monitor should be able to provide a copy of its reports on this legislation to the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security at the same time those reports are provided to the Prime Minister and that the monitor should be empowered to brief the committee on his or her findings. This goes directly to the oversight of the use of these new powers to the parliament through the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One would have thought, given the work that the committee did considering these extraordinary new powers—making recommendations on a way to improve them, making recommendations to ensure that they work, that they keep Australians safe, that they are constitutionally valid—that, when we are taking the extraordinary step of barring a citizen from having a free right to enter their own country, when we have good reason to do that because of the circumstances I've just outlined and when we are organising and putting conditions on the manner in which they return and on how they will live in Australia, it would be appropriate that the parliamentary joint committee have that ability to have oversight.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This recommendation is actually consistent with recommendation 23, sub-recommendation d), of the 2017 National Intelligence Review, which recommended that the role of the intelligence committee be expanded to:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… to request a briefing from the Independent National Security Legislation Monitor (the Monitor), to ask the Monitor to provide the PJCIS with a report on matters referred by the PJCIS, and for the Monitor to provide the PJCIS with the outcome of the Monitor's inquiries into existing legislation at the same time as the Monitor provides such reports to the responsible Minister …</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So this recommendation from the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security, which is dominated by Liberal members, mirrors exactly the national intelligence review ordered by then Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull. This was an independent review of our national security laws and this is exactly the recommendation they made. A parliamentary joint committee where the Liberals have the majority, the government has the majority, has made the same recommendation to the government and here today the government, in its legislation before this parliament, is actually rejecting that recommendation.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When that 2017 national intelligence review was released publicly, then Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull said, as he stood next to the now Minister for Home Affairs, that the government had accepted the recommendations of the review. Well, in rejecting this recommendation 16, the government has now told the parliament that it is still considering the recommendations of the 2017 Independent Intelligence Review. So what has changed? What has changed since Prime Minister Turnbull said the government have accepted the recommendations and today the Minister for Home Affairs and the government in their response to this bill and these recommendations from the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security now say they're just considering them? They haven't accepted them; they're just considering them now. What has changed? Well, we know the Prime Minister has changed. Perhaps that's it; I don't know. Again, if this matter had come back to the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security—quite frankly, if the chair had done his job as chair and sought to bring the government's response back so we could examine it or we could question it—we could seek to understand why the government had made changes and we might be able to answer this.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But two years after the public release of the 2017 National Intelligence Review, it's time for the Minister for Home Affairs to do his job and actually implement this recommendation, and if he can't do that then he needs to explain what has changed since 2017. Why did the government say in 2017 that they would implement this recommendation? Why did the government members on the PJCIS in April of this year recommend that this be implemented? And why now is the Minister for Home Affairs taking a backward step? He's opposed to oversight?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have extraordinary powers. Is he opposed to oversight? Does he fear parliamentary scrutiny? This is a committee his own government has the majority on. This is a committee that has extraordinary access to information. It wouldn't be the first time the committee has received confidential or secret information, but the committee should have this oversight. The parliament should have a body that it is confident is providing oversight.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But here we have it. In 2017, they accepted oversight. In April this year, the Liberal members—were they going rogue? Had they gone rogue? Had they not consulted with the government before they made these recommendations? I think that's an interesting question to contemplate. How do we get to a circumstance where six Liberal members of a committee sign their names to 18 recommendations that are now being rejected in whole or in part by their own government? Did these six Liberal members go rogue? Senator Stoker, Senator Fawcett and Senator Abetz: did they go rogue?</span>

Amendment (1) that I am moving here today would fully implement the sensible, the modest and the unanimously agreed 16th recommendation of the intelligence security committee, which simply seeks to give effect to the 2017 national intelligence review, which former Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull told us the coalition government had already adopted. I call on members opposite and the crossbench to support this amendment.</span>

Following representations by Minister Taylor, then Minister Frydenberg's office arranged a meeting which took place on 20 March 2017 between Minister Taylor, Minister Frydenberg's office and members of the Department of the Environment and Energy to discuss a listing which affected Mr Taylor's private landholding.

The Australia-US alliance is the cornerstone of Australia's defence and security policy. The strength of our alliance is based on our common values, our shared vision and a commitment to peace, prosperity and stability in our immediate region and beyond. It's wonderful to note that we are now in the second century of unbroken mateship and global support and military co-operation. We have got 80 years of diplomatic relations and nearly 70 years of ANZUS co-operation. Our alliance is stronger than ever. It has never been more important or more vital to us than it is today, because today Australia faces challenges that are increasing in number and complexity, challenges that are rapidly redefining our strategic environment. </span>

This is the message I relayed recently to the very newly appointed US Secretary of Defense, Mark Esper. I warmly congratulate him on his confirmation and I look forward to working with him. </span>

It is our largest and most complex exercise. Over 34,000 military personnel from Australia and the United States participated in Talisman Sabre this year. Talisman Sabre took place at the Defence Shoalwater Bay training area and surrounding state forest near Rockhampton and other locations in Queensland. Force elements from Japan, Canada, the United Kingdom and New Zealand joined in Talisman Sabre.</span>

The Marine Rotational Force-Darwin provides critical strategic and security benefits for both Australia and the United States. By us training together, the warfare fighting capabilities and interoperability of the ADF and the US forces is enhanced. The rotation also provides opportunities to strengthen engagement with other allies and partners in the Indo-Pacific region.</span>

Minister, according to the data from the Department of Social Services, the average amount of time someone spends on Newstart is 156 weeks—that is, three years.

First of all, nobody has ever said it would be easy to live on Newstart. And I can assure you that the government's—of which I am a member—absolute No. 1 priority is to make sure that anybody who's currently on Newstart is given the best opportunity to get a job. Newstart was never meant to be a salary or a wage replacement; it's a safety net. I acknowledge that it wouldn't be easy to live on Newstart; however, this government remains absolutely committed to anybody who is on Newstart. We will do everything we possibly can to get them a job.</span>

That was part of the question.</span>

                  </a>  In continuing my response to the senator's question, I was actually trying to draw to the senator's attention that the creation of jobs is the best way that we can get people off Newstart and to make sure they're on Newstart for a shorter period of time. If the jobs aren't available in the economy for people who are on Newstart and who are looking for a job, then that makes it extremely difficult. As I said: 1.3 million jobs since we've been in government and a plan to create more than a million more. But it's not just about creating jobs; it's also about creating the pathways to those jobs, which we also see as a very important part of the government's role. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

We accept that the most important role that we have—and I certainly accept it as my most important role in the development of social policy—is to make sure that we make the lives of every Australian better. For somebody who hasn't got a job, obviously that is to provide the opportunity for them to get a job. Part of that is in the employment sector, where my colleague, Senator Cash, who's unfortunately not here this week, through her jobactive, is creating the opportunity for people to understand that jobs are being created in the economy and providing them pathways to get those jobs. But also, in the disability sector, one of the things we're doing as a government is investing very strongly in disability employment services to make sure that people with disability have an equally strong chance of being able to get a job and are able to participate in the economy to the level that they want to.</span>

As I said before, in the answer to her original question, nobody is saying it will be easy to live on Newstart. Nobody's saying it would be easy to live without a job. That is why the absolute focus of this government is to create jobs and to create pathways for people who don't have a job to get a job. As I said, and I said it in both of the answers to the previous questions, the focus of this government is absolutely on job creation and pathways to jobs. For people who are currently on Newstart, the promise that this government will give them is that we will do everything we possibly can to get them off Newstart and into a job.</span>

Because people across Australia understood that it was our team that would help build a stronger economy. It would be our team that would help create more jobs. It will be our team that will help ensure that Australians can be safe and secure. They understood and they rejected the politics of envy pursued by the Labor Party. They rejected the high-taxing, antibusiness, sneering-at-the-top-end-of-town agenda, which Australians understood would have made our economy weaker, would have made our country weaker and would have left every Australian worse off.</span>

They decided that they could trust us and that they couldn't trust the Labor Party. That is because the Labor Party went to the election with a promise to take $30 billion out of their superannuation savings, and that is even before we talk about the retiree tax, the housing tax and the higher taxes on income. Let me tell you, the Australian people know precisely who they can trust with their retirement savings, and they certainly also know that they can't trust the Labor Party.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:24</span>):  My question is to Senator McKenzie, representing the Minister for Water Resources, Drought, Rural Finance, Natural Disaster and Emergency Management. Australia's population has grown by five million, or 25 per cent, since 2007. During this 12-year period, the price of water has increased dramatically, causing hardship for rural and regional communities. This hardship could have been avoided if the government had invested in water security and not become the single largest owner of water in the Murray-Darling River system. The federal government owns 28 per cent of all water entitlements in the southern basin of the Murray-Darling, which means droughts there are experienced earlier and more intensely than would otherwise be the case. This scale of water ownership cannot be justified when the government is unwilling or unable to prepare a detailed water management plan for Australia. What is stopping you from taking the necessary action to reduce immigration until we can create nation-building water projects like the hybrid Bradfield scheme or like?</span>

                  </a>  Thank you, Senator Hanson, for the clarification. I'm more than happy to go to the question around what we in the Liberal-National government are doing around nation-building water infrastructure. We are getting on with the job. We're building new water infrastructure to meet the needs of regional Australia. We've committed more than $3.3 billion in funding, through the $1.3 billion National Water Infrastructure Development Fund and the $2 billion national water infrastructure loan, to build dams, weirs and pipelines. Our government has already committed more than $990 million through the fund to co-fund the construction of 21 water infrastructure projects, with a total construction value of about $1.98 billion. Funding is flowing to build projects in your home state of Queensland, as well as Victoria, South Australia and Tasmania.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These vital water infrastructure projects will increase water availability to our job-producing agricultural regions and will create more than 4,600 jobs and provide access to more than 45,000 megalitres of new, secure and affordable water. Our investments in these projects will guarantee new and affordable water for regional Australia into the future and unlock the economic potential for new and expanded agriculture right across regional Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In addition to bringing new water infrastructure, the government's providing more than $119.5 million for 51 studies to get water infrastructure projects off the drawing board, including more than $59 million for Urannah Dam, Emu Swamp Dam, Hells Gate Dam and Big Rocks Weir. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

This week, the Australian National University hosted a forum, and the title of the forum was 'The coal transition forum'. It was here in Canberra, to discuss jobs in North Queensland. At that forum, the shadow minister for climate change, Mr Pat Conroy, gave a speech in which he said that global demand for thermal coal is in structural decline. He said that there's a proactive role for government in achieving a just transition for the coal industry, and he said that Labor will continue to work on alternative policies for a just transition.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, when we hear the words 'just transition' up there in North Queensland they sound a little bit confusing. What exactly is a just transition? The Labor Party, thankfully, did actually outline this before the last federal election. In their policy—in their own documents—the Labor Party promised to:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">… establish an independent Just Transition Authority to help plan for and coordinate the response to the eventual closure of coal-fired power stations …</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And associated mines. They said that the authority will, as a minimum, have the power to implement pooled redundancy schemes for workers in coal-fired power stations and mines. So the Labor Party, the so-called workers party, have established a bureaucracy here in Canberra to put people out of a job! That was going to be the job of the just transition authority under a Labor government here in Canberra. The people in North and Central Queensland aren't fools. They know they're not fighting for their jobs—they're going to put them out of a job. With the Labor Party, we need to understand where they are post election, because Mr Fitzgibbon, the shadow minister for resources, is out there saying that global coal demand will go up. Pat Conroy is saying it will go down. Which one is it? </span>

I know and I know Senator Macdonald knows—living in these areas, we talk to people about what might happen if these things happen. People like Mr Kelly Appleton, who's the publican of the Grand Hotel in Clermont in Central Queensland, spells it out very clearly. He says, 'People don't realise that if the mines close so do the towns'. That's exactly what happens. If the mines go, the towns go, the schools go, the petrol stations go, the newsagents go, the jobs go. That's what happens. And that's why we're supporting the development of these communities and supporting the development of our great coal industry, our nation's biggest exporter. We'd like to see it bigger and better and creating more jobs and more wealth for regional towns and more opportunities for the families who live in Central and North Queensland.</span>

It's fantastic because the growing demand for energy in our region means that countries will continue to demand high-quality resources, and we are lucky enough to have been blessed with some of the highest quality coal in the world. So, that will continue to be a very strong industry for our nation, as long as we allow it to do what it does best. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Indeed, the International Energy Agency predicts that in the next 20 years or so, or by 2040, demand for thermal coal will grow by almost 500 million tonnes of coal equivalent. The Australian industry only produces about 250 million tonnes of coal a year, including our domestic needs. So it's an incredible opportunity for our nation to capture—if we support these jobs and support these regions, and, of course, if we also continue to provide high-quality energy to the rest of the world. </span>

Between 2014 and 2017, the New South Wales Ombudsman found that there were no less than 42 preventable deaths of disabled people in New South Wales residential care, including 11 deaths via choking. During this period, Commissioner Ryan was a senior public servant of the very New South Wales department responsible for the care of these individuals. Of these 42 preventable deaths, the Ombudsman found that there were two where a direct link existed between the death and a program that Mr Ryan oversaw. In light of these conflicts of interest, can the government understand why disabled people, particularly in New South Wales, feel like they are being asked to disclose to their abusers? </span>

But I would also like to put on record in this chamber that it is the Morrison government that set up the Royal Commission into Violence, Abuse, Neglect and Exploitation of People with Disability, and that the Prime Minister himself is an extraordinarily strong advocate for supporting people with disability. I look forward to, in a minute, actually explaining to the chamber some of the initiatives that the Morrison government has put in place and intends to put in place to support people with disability. Senator Steele-John, I very much look forward to working with you in my capacity as the Minister for Families and Social Services to make sure that we can make the lives of all Australians, particularly those with disability, better.</span>

The government doesn't want to do anything of the sort. The government supports choice, though, and the government supports measures which help ensure that, in particular, small superannuation balances aren't inappropriately eroded by fees going into the pockets of insurance providers in relation to insurance that might not be appropriate to their needs. This is obviously a matter that has been discussed for some time in this chamber, and this chamber has, indeed, already passed some important reform in this space designed to protect the retirement savings of working families around Australia. The government stands by the measures that it's put forward.</span>

Thank you very much for this extremely important question. One of the things that a strong economy does for Australia and for all Australians is it provides job opportunities, and none could be more important than providing job opportunities for people with disability, because this government, the Morrison government, believes in encouraging people. We believe in encouraging aspiration, providing opportunity and rewarding effort. We want people who live with disability to have a choice and some control around their life so they can achieve their goals.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the things that the Morrison government has announced is an investment of $3 billion into the Disability Employment Services Program. Through this program, we particularly want to target workplace initiatives such as workplace modifications and adjustments, so people with disability can find it easier to work in their workplace, and support wage system assessments, wage subsidy schemes and a national disability recruitment coordinator.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Just last year, the Morrison government changed the disability employment service program to help more people with disability find a job. I'm pleased to say that 234,000 people use the Disability Employment Services program. And through this program, we are seeing improvements in the results for people with disability achieving the outcomes that they want for themselves. We have seen participation rates increase by 21 per cent, 41,000 people are accessing the support that they need and 15,000 people have not only been assisted in finding work but also in remaining in that work. On this side of the chamber, we believe it is our responsibility to do everything we can to get all Australians back into work and that includes helping Australians who are working with disability and living with disability to get a job as well.</span>

We want to make sure all Australians who live with a disability have the ability to contribute to the Australian economy to their best ability. It's not just good for them; it's good for their families, it's good for their community and it is good for the Australian economy for everybody and anybody to have a job.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last year, the Morrison government kicked off the Employ their Ability campaign, which was designed around creating awareness of the ability and the contribution that people with disability can make in the workplace. We're pleased to announce that we have already encouraged 105 large companies and organisations to recognise the benefits of employing people with disability. We went to the last election with a suite of measures that, whilst they are ambitions, we think are absolutely achievable. We've asked the Public Service to make sure that seven per cent of the people who work in the Public Service have a disability. We've announced also $45 million to develop a national disability gateway, amongst myriad other initiatives.</span>

I understand his obvious interest in the very exciting bid for the 2032 Olympics that's been proposed, particularly, by the South-East Queensland mayors and the opportunities that the bid will bring to South-East Queensland. There's enthusiasm for the bid from the Prime Minister, and Mr Ted O'Brien has been appointed as the Prime Minister's representative to push the bid forward.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We were delighted to see the Queensland government finally coming on board with some action for participation in the process to bid for the 2032 Olympics. I must say though that they were somewhat lacklustre. The Commonwealth government put $10 million on the table to support this bid during the election campaign. That was welcomed by the mayors of South-East Queensland and, of course, the Australian Olympic Committee. The process has been, I think, very well set up for Australia to be in a very strong position to be successful in its bid. The Queensland government have, effectively, offered some in-kind assistance, but they need to get on board properly. They need to join the Australian government. They need to join the Australian Olympic Committee. They need to join the community of South-East Queensland in being actively supportive of this bid, but they are not. They are putting a very slow time frame on their economic impact survey, which needs to be completed quickly. They're saying they'll do it next year. It should be done this year. We face the possibility of losing the very exciting window that we have to be a leading nation bidding for the 2032 Olympics and losing all of the advantages that would bring to this country. I certainly urge the Queensland government to actively get on board. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

We're backing the Football Federation's bid for the 2023 FIFA Women's World Cup. We have also announced funding to support bids for the 2027 Netball World Cup and Rugby Australia's bid for the 2027 World Cup.

It demonstrates the importance of these events and what the industry of sport can bring to the Australian economy. Currently in Australia the sports industry employs a workforce of more than 220,000 people. It's responsible for spending more than $12 billion through sport and sport infrastructure each year. That's why this is so serious. Securing major international sporting events, such as the Olympics, not only inspires the next generation of athletes in this country but also strengthens Australia's sports industry. It strengthens those numbers that I've just talked about. Our government is also committed to the development of the sports industry growth plan. We announced that as part of our 2030 sports plan, which was presented by Senator McKenzie last year. We have a very, very strong commitment to the sports sector in this country and to the employment that goes with it.</span>

I think you mentioned the report was in 2015? Is that right? I can't actually recall the Senate committee report myself. I can't necessarily, therefore, confirm or otherwise the specific quote that has been made from it. I can't recall, myself, whether I was the author of those words, or simply a signatory to them or otherwise. It's a bit hard to comment on something that of course is well outside the portfolio of the Minister for Resources and Northern Australia.</span>

It's not a matter of trust, Senator Gallacher; it is about making sure, of course, that objectives are met—different objectives and different responsibilities—in independent ways across policymaking. But, as I said, I would have to check the record before I could confirm or otherwise the status of a Senate committee report from, I think, around four years ago.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">As our population gets older, ensuring a fair and proper superannuation system is vital. This is especially the case for women, who have child-raising breaks in their career and a longer life expectancy than men. In the early nineties, the very idea of compulsory superannuation was denounced by the LNP, those opposite, and the business lobby as a 'company killer'—that unemployment would rise and the economy would be damaged. All that was wrong, of course. Now we have the LNP again, led by Senator Bragg, telling low-income earners that superannuation isn't working for them. It's a bit rich for someone on over $200,000 a year to tell someone on less than $50,000 a year that they don't need a decent retirement income. How dare they? Not to be left out on his own, in the other place Mr Tim Wilson and Mr Craig Kelly also want to talk about the planned super rate rise to 12 per cent being handed to workers as being a 'pay rise', not superannuation. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This LNP government want to get their hands on the superannuation of workers. They want to take it away. They want to stop them getting the rise. Senator Cormann stood here today and said he refuted that, but he didn't rule out that it would be in the review. He didn't rule that out. How dare they come in here and tell people on low incomes that they're not worthy of a decent retirement income, that they should look forward to their retirement existing on the age pension—that's what they expect them to do—and not have anything extra to enjoy those little things in life like maybe a visit to their interstate family or that little trip that they could not afford in their younger days when they were raising their kids, struggling every day on a pension to pay their power bills, to buy food, to buy medications. They want them to do all that again while existing on the age pension.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that women have less superannuation than men. I've highlighted that many times in this place. But until the superannuation guarantee act came into place in the early 1990s, many working women had no retirement savings at all. There were many men who also had no retirement savings until that act came into place. But let me tell you a little bit about the working women. Women currently retire with 47 per cent less superannuation than men. On average, women live five years longer than men. Women only receive a third of the government tax concessions on super. Men receive the other two-thirds. Forty per cent of older single retired women live in poverty and experience economic insecurity in their retirement. Some 46.9 per cent of women are in the workforce. So the statistics are skewed. Forty-four per cent of women rely on their partner's income as the main source of funds for their retirement. The average female salary is $44,000. That includes part-time workers. Female graduates earn $5,000 less than male graduates in the same role. Women spend an average of five hours more per day caring for children than men. Forty-three per cent of women work part-time and yet they earn under $50,000. The statistics are glaring. What the backbench over there, and in the other place, are supporting is that that money should not be going into a superannuation fund for these workers to retire on. It is outrageous. Women take an average of five years out of the workforce to care for their families. So what we're seeing here again and again are deep divisions in the government ranks, with the Prime Minister urging his MPs to go through the usual internal party processes. But there are a growing number of Liberal MPs who are agitating on this issue. To them and to the Prime Minister I have four words: hands off our super. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Agriculture and Leader of The Nationals in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:10</span>):  Isn't it interesting how afraid those opposite are of bright ideas? This is the season of maiden speeches and, thanks to a very successful election outcome by the Liberal and National parties on 18 May, you're going to hear a lot of new ideas from our bright new senators and MPs elected in that particular election, where Australians chose to back the Liberal-National parties and our candidates to continue to deliver a strong economy and to continue to work to ensure that that strong economy delivers local jobs right around Australia. We're not afraid of ideas, so you're going to hear a lot of different reasons why people have come here. On your side, you'll only hear one reason: 'My union has a view, and it wants it expressed in the Australian parliament.' That's all that your new senators and MPs will be contributing to this place. 'My union needs me to stick up for them here in this place,' Whereas our new members and senators have a whole range of things they want to see delivered over a period of time, and their maiden speeches are the time to do that.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What you shouldn't get confused about is a maiden speech by a new senator or MP and government policy—two very different things. We're not afraid of new ideas, and we look forward to discussing and debating the many wonderful ideas that have been raised—and some old chestnuts, as well, that always get dusted off and brought out at maiden speech time—over the course of our careers, but the government's position on superannuation is clear. It has not changed, and to try to use people's contributions here in their maiden speech—the philosophies that they've all brought, the diversity that our party rooms bring to this place—as somehow a proxy for government policy is just ridiculous and actually shows how desperate you are, how despondent you are at the result of 18 May.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our government's policy on superannuation guarantee hasn't changed. Let me be unequivocal on that. To come into this place and bray on as if somehow we're going to dismantle the retirement of senior Australians on the back of someone's maiden speech is absolutely ridiculous. Our focus on superannuation is actually to get rid of high fees, duplicate accounts, underperforming funds and unnecessary insurance, because one thing we on this side of parliament want to see is that hardworking Australians get to keep more of their own money. We did that by promising income tax cuts and, thanks to this place passing those income tax cuts in the last sitting, more Australians—94 per cent of hardworking Australians—will get an income tax cut over coming years, getting to keep more of their hard-earned cash. We don't apologise for that. That is actually why we sought election and is actually part of our mandate.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australians need to have confidence in our superannuation system and be assured that it's going to be used for its core purpose, which is actually providing income into retirement. Our government believes it's essential that the superannuation sector be managed with the highest level of responsibility and integrity for the benefit of members. If only we could be confident that the Australian union movement could be managed in a way that workers could have confidence in its integrity and that it was actually being focused on members' interests and not on the interests of the union thugs such as John Setka. I'm really looking forward to Anthony Albanese explaining how supporting the expulsion of Mr Setka from the Labor Party but not supporting legislation that would actually make it happen—</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator GALLACHER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:15</span>):  I too rise to take note of the answer given by Senator Cormann to a question asked by my colleague Senator Marielle Smith. At the outset, in response to Senator Cormann's statement, 'All this was transparent throughout the election campaign, all this was part of the policies we put to the people,' I want to use one example from Senator Bragg's speech, and it goes to the point:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">We have the fourth-largest private pension pool in the world with only 25 million people. It remains a strange but huge experiment. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Where, in what land, does a contribution in this chamber about having the fourth-largest savings pool in the world from a relatively small population become, somehow, a 'strange but huge experiment'? It is a very successful example of what Australia can do well. It's not without challenges, but you never went to the election saying you're going to delay superannuation payments of 12.5 per cent. You never went to the election and said: 'We've got this strange, huge experiment; we've actually got too much money in workers' retirement accounts!' Try and sell that out there! </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Kerry Packer said, 'You only get one Alan Bond in your lifetime and I've had mine.' Maybe the senator will be the one we get. We'll only get one Senator Andrew Bragg, who's so ridiculous in his ideology that he's going to go try and tell 10 million or 12 million Australian workers they've got 'too much money in their accounts! Too much money! It's a strange experiment!' What a load of you know; come on. Anyway, we're lucky to have him. This is good for us. I'm sure that people who have an $80,000, $90,000 or $100,000 investment account in super are going to look at his comments and say: 'They're more than passing strange. I get comfort from having a retirement balance of whatever amount. If I get TPD, income protection and, dare I say, life insurance from a respectable group life insurance policy, I get some comfort from that as well.' </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Urquhart is exactly right. There is no greater example of the disparity of the earning capacity of women than in superannuation. Their accounts are invariably lower, they're invariably out of the workforce for longer periods of time and they're almost always lower-paid. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I've had people put it to me that the actual value of that superannuation account for most of their 35 or 40 working years, is the security of having group insurance for death, TPD and income protection. When they do get to that retirement phase, they have had that security overlay in all their working life. If you lot take it away for younger people and for less fortunate people in the workforce who earn less money, what happens when they get injured? What happens when they're totally and permanently disabled and can no longer work? What happens if, unfortunately, someone gets killed and they've got dependants? I actually know, because we used to have a barbecue—I worked at mine sites where we donated a day's pay after a death. I know what the system was before, and you lot want to take us halfway back there. It's an absolute disgrace! And you let loose those ideologues over the back there—the Patersons, the Stokers—probably never done a decent hard day's work in their lives! You let loose those ideologues—</span>

                  </a>  I said 'Senator Stoker' and then 'Paterson', so thank you—point of order taken. The reality is we know what the world was like prior to '84, '86 and '87, when unions created industry super funds. We know how immeasurably better the world became in '92 when it became the superannuation guarantee. We've had 27 years of uninterrupted economic growth, and our pride in our savings pool should be a national pride. We can do better, and no-one on this side of the chamber says anything other. But to take away that security overlay that is there in group life insurance is fraught with real challenges, and it will impact on the most vulnerable. And you need to see that, rather than having the tax take in the forward estimates of $600 million.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  <a href="N26" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator ABETZ</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:21</span>):  You know the Australian Labor Party's on the back foot when they raise, as the issue of the day, two sentences out of the maiden speech of the most rookie senator in this place. To pick two sentences out of an excellently crafted speech and to try to make that the issue of the day tells the Australian people, yet again, something they already know—that the Labor Party are devoid of a forward agenda. They have no policies to pursue. Indeed, today's great agenda item for the Labor Party is to attack two sentences in Senator Bragg's first speech. Really? Is this the best the Labor Party can do? Regrettably, the answer's yes—that's the best they can do.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And why is it that the two particular senators that raised this issue felt so compelled to do it? All you've got to do is ask, 'What did they do before they came to this retirement home for washed-out trade union officials?' Oh, they happened to be trade union officials and trade union bosses. And from this super scheme that Senator Bragg referred to, who are the great beneficiaries? Oh, it happens to be the trade union movement. The trade union movement milks money from these funds, and guess where the money finds its way back to? To the Australian Labor Party! And guess what they do with it? They run campaigns to elect their union officials to this place. It is the full circle of the money-go-round of ripping off workers to ensure that the Labor Party gets sufficient funds. Why do they need these super schemes? Because the union officials who have just spoken have seen a decline in trade union membership. They can no longer run on the voluntary contributions of workers wanting to join a union.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Membership in the trade union movement has collapsed. It is now about one in 10 in the private sector. Ninety per cent of Australia's private sector workers don't want to be in a union. 'Oh, how do we get money out of them in that case', asks the Labor Party, 'if we can't force them into a union anymore?' What better way than to have a super scheme which, with a few little add-ones, can be milked to ensure a stream of income for the trade union movement? That is what we've seen today from the contributions of Senator Urquhart and Senator Gallacher, both former trade union officials concerned about the funding stream for their unions for their ongoing longevity.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's be clear, Labor senators come into this place basically as ventriloquist's dolls from the trade union that they formerly represented, whereas senators that come in on this side of the chamber come from a unique and varied background. Senators on this side of the chamber aren't ventriloquist's dolls for certain interests. They are not the cookie-cutter types of senators that come from the Labor Party's side. They are all individuals with good dynamic ideas that are worthy of consideration and worthy of exploring.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As the leader in the Senate quite rightly said, just because a new senator in his first speech explores a particular idea in two sentences out of a 20- or 25-minute speech does not make that idea government policy. That is why the Labor Party's latching onto this shows the desperation of the Australian Labor Party. They have no ideas of their own, nothing to offer by way of a positive contribution and nothing to suggest how the cost-of-living pressure might be able to be reduced for the Australian people. They say, 'What is the issue of the day? Let's pick on two sentences from the speech of a brand new senator who floated an idea for consideration.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Whilst the Labor Party continues to wallow in this type of activity the Australian people will be quite right in their ongoing rejection of the Australian Labor Party. I would encourage the Labor Party to use this facility in the Senate to take note of answers to advance positive ideas for the benefit of the nation. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Northern Territory</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:26</span>):  What we're doing on this side of the House is seeking clarity, better information and understanding. The desperation is not from this side of the House. The desperation is in those families who are struggling to feed their children, who are struggling to live on CDP—$11 a day—and who are struggling to live on Newstart. That's where the desperation is. So when a senator comes into the chamber and brings forward ideas we naturally will ask and examine: 'Where is the government going on this? How can Australians bank on what Senator Cormann says when members of his own government are touting more interference, in this case in superannuation?'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the Northern Territory alone we have a figure of more than $200 million in lost and unclaimed super owed to people in the Northern Territory. I realise that this may be a small amount in the nationwide figure of $17.5 billion in lost super, but it is a huge amount for a population of less than 250,000 people. Thirty per cent of the population in the Northern Territory are First Nations people. So it is imperative that, when an idea or a concept as important as superannuation is even questioned, we challenge it and ask questions around it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have an ever-growing number of government members speaking out and undermining assurances from senior cabinet members about superannuation increases. It should be straightforward. These increases should proceed as guaranteed in law, yet we have even brand new senators talking about what they want to see happen with superannuation. Good luck to them, obviously, and welcome to the Senate, but also welcome to the scrutiny that is required of each and every senator. We all know that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Bragg made a very interesting first speech last night. Much of it I was very happy to hear, in particular that part around First Nations and their voice to parliament. But he also threw in the idea that, for some reason, superannuation contributions should be voluntary for low-income earners. So people who are low-income earners can look forward to an old age of poverty? These are the questions we have to now examine and ask. Or maybe they can live on the pension that Senator Ruston thinks is so generous.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Bragg's statement that First Nations people should be rightly and properly recognised in the Australian Constitution is to be applauded. He's one of the first members of the government to support the inclusion of an Indigenous advisory body in the nation's founding document. But what is the government's actual position on constitutional recognition of Australia's First Peoples?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When we come in here and talk about superannuation, there is a lot that the government can turn its attention to to make sure the super system is working for all Australians. I've given you the figure in terms of the people of the Northern Territory. Recently, a Victorian charity called First Nations Foundation was in the Top End helping Territorians, particularly residents in our remote areas. As we know, in the Northern Territory over 100 Aboriginal languages are spoken. Those people were able to listen to the First Nations Foundation on how they can reclaim their lost super. Understanding the super system is a massive struggle for First Nations people and others with English as a second or third language living in remote areas. I mean, oh my goodness, you can have the best education, but understanding the super system is still a complex process, so imagine what it's like for those people who have English as a second or third language. It's extraordinarily difficult.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Arnhem Land Progress Aboriginal Corporation's chief executive, Alastair King, has rightly said that the superannuation industry really needs to lift its game for people living in remote regions. In areas where internet access is poor or basically non-existent, it can be incredibly difficult to access this sort of information. Most people don't even know where to start looking for their lost super funds or even know they had superannuation funds they could rollover or access. The superannuation system has been pretty slow in adopting strategies that protect vulnerable customers. That's why this side of the house needs to keep you guys accountable.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I asked three questions, none of which the minister could properly address. I asked her why the government continues to call Newstart a 'transition payment' when the average length of time on the payment is three years. It's clearly not a transition payment, so I'd say that myth about Newstart is busted.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also asked the minister about older Australians on Newstart. Today it was reported that the Prime Minister said that if he were to increase any payment, it would be the age pension. And we have the ridiculous situation where we have someone at 64 living on $287.90 less than someone on the age pension at 65½, for example. That is ridiculous. Newstart needs to be increased If the Prime Minister, Mr Morrison, cared about older Australians, he would realise that being stuck on Newstart is harming those very older Australians that he professes to care about.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My last question was whether the minister could live on Newstart, not only with already having paid the rent but also with the energy supplement, because the one thing that the government keeps saying is that people on Newstart—this is another myth—get all these other payments, so they don't need a rise in Newstart. Could the minister live on $17.65? She couldn't answer that question, because, of course, she knows she can't. She said, 'It wasn't meant to be easy.' She said in her answers, 'It's not meant to be a salary; it's a safety net.' It's not a safety net; it just drops people straight through. Of course she can't live on it, because nobody can live on it. We need to raise Newstart. It needs to happen immediately. It needs to be raised by at least $75 a week.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">That was no answer at all. Three questions I posed to the minister: could she understand our frustration, could she see why we felt like we were being made to disclose to our abusers, and would the government listen to the united calls of the disability community—and now the united voice of the Senate—and call on these commissioners to resign? What was the answer? 'Oh, they're very eminent individuals. They have AOs, they have PSMs.' Well, that is no answer at all. I would remind the chamber that there are many eminent people throughout history. I believe Rolf Harris is one who could claim the Order of Australia. It goes nowhere near addressing as respectfully as should be done the legitimate concerns of the disability community in relation to this matter. </span>

And then here you go, coming in and disrupting the business of this Senate and preventing us from scrutinising things, like important government documents, in order to jam it through as quickly as possible. There is no need for this unseemly rush. It's poor legislation anyway and, in fact, the government should have supported it being referred to a Senate inquiry so that we could make appropriate inquiries and recommendations on it. The Greens do not support this motion. </span>

The government waited four years to bring this scheme in. They announced it in November, they put it forward in February, they sent it off to the committee, the committee reported back in April and here we are in July, finally debating this legislation after four years. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">This week the government prioritised a drought fund bill ahead of this legislation. They pushed that through the House ahead of this legislation. This legislation could have been in the Senate much earlier this week. This legislation that they say is an imperative—that it is a policy imperative and an operational imperative that we have this legislation passed—could have been done earlier this week. But they put forward a drought fund bill. I'm not saying drought and helping our farmers aren't important, but that drought fund doesn't start for two years. This, they say, is important. The drought fund doesn't start for two years, but that was their priority. The opposition will be supporting this hours motion, because we don't want to leave here this week without this legislation passing the parliament. That's why we're supporting this motion. But I want it on the record that the government has had four years and had plenty of time this week, and it didn't get it done. We want to make sure it gets done before we leave Canberra this week. That's why we're supporting this motion.</span>

It's clear that the review authority has all of those restrictions that you mentioned in your answer to me. Section 14 sets out the things that the review authority can consider. They are restrictive in some nature, and I understand your logic; you say that that process is to be quick. Leaving that alone, and noting the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act is carved out as a pathway, that leaves two methods by which to bring an action to the Federal Court. One is through section 39 of the Judiciary Act, and the other is through section 75 of the Constitution. If it were to go to a judicial review—so not the review authority—is it a matter considered to be in the original jurisdiction of the court as opposed to the appeals jurisdiction?</span>

I listened to you, prior to the break, telling the chamber that you can't review on a question of fact. The whole point of the original jurisdiction is that you appeal and you have all facts laid out by way of affidavit and other methods to bring information before the court. Only in an appellant jurisdiction do you restrict the appeal to a point of law. So there's something not quite right here. Can you perhaps clear the air, please?</span>

It's a simple question. I'm not asking about the Evidence Act; if you say that it is in the original jurisdiction, by definition that means you can introduce evidence to a court—which basically is a way of introducing facts to the court. So there's a difference in what you've told the Senate this morning, or previously, and what you're telling it now. There's an inconsistency in that. I'm just asking you to clarify that, please.</span>

You might recall I gave an example of a situation where perhaps a mistake had been made by ASIO. In order to initiate a TEO, we have got to have some sort of brief before the minister. My concern is that, at the next stage, the brief is not tested. You can shrug your shoulders, Minister, but there might be someone innocent caught up in this, and we need to be very respectful of the manner in which we treat citizens who may well have been subject to false intelligence. I don't mind if we take someone who is a terrorist and we deal with them as suggested by the act. My only concern here is that when ASIO presents information that is flawed in some way, it needs to be tested at some stage along the way. In the original jurisdiction of a court, that can be tested. You said that it's in the original jurisdiction but then you said it can't be appealed on a question of fact. So there's an inconsistency in your answer and I'm trying to get to that inconsistency. Can you please help me out, Minister?</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I observed in my speech on the second reading, notwithstanding its extraordinary nature the bill before the Senate is part of a well-established pattern. The measures before the Senate today are but another instalment in the steady stream of national security legislation that has come before the parliament over the last two decades. Much of it was spurred on by September 11. Much of this legislation, advanced by both coalition and Labor governments and almost always with bipartisan support, has expanded the powers of our intelligence and security agencies. I might point out that many of the powers that are used by these agencies are used in secret. The agencies themselves have also expanded greatly in size, budget and the scope of their activities. Australia's 10 national security and intelligence agencies now employ more than 7,000 people and spend well over $2 billion each year while they accumulate massive amounts of information at home and abroad. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">However, while Australia's intelligence community has grown rapidly over the past two decades, the mechanisms of accountability and review, in terms of overseeing those agencies, have received much less attention, fewer resources and less authority. This is especially the case with the parliament's own scrutiny machine. That vital scrutiny role remains strictly limited. Specifically, the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security, the PJCIS, is tightly restricted under the Intelligence Services Act 2001 to review only administrative and financial aspects of Australia's intelligence and security agencies. The PJCIS is explicitly prohibited from reviewing the operations of the Australian intelligence agencies. The PJCIS is further restricted in reviewing intelligence-gathering priorities and the operation of Australian intelligence agencies or the assessments and reports they produce. The committee is barred from examining operational activities and methods or any operations that have been, are being or are proposed to be undertaken by intelligence and national security services. The PJCIS is also prohibited from reviewing the privacy rules made by ministers that regulate the communication and retention by agencies of intelligence information concerning Australian persons. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These limitations on parliamentary scrutiny have reflected a historical reluctance of past governments and intelligence agencies to trust members of parliament outside the executive with the most sensitive intelligence information. However, the PJCIS can't hold these agencies properly accountable for their activities if parliament continues to ban its own committees from reviewing their operations and other activities, nor can expenditure and administration be adequately examined without consideration of operational performance. They go together. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The exclusion of intelligence operations from parliamentary scrutiny is not an approach followed by some of Australia's closest allies. Indeed, Australian practice now stands in stark contrast to parliamentary oversight arrangements in the other Five Eyes countries—the United States, the United Kingdom, New Zealand and Canada. In the United States, congressional oversight of the intelligence community is spread across several committees, including specialised committees on intelligence in the House of Representatives and the Senate. Those committees have long enjoyed the ability to inquire into all intelligence related activities of the United States government, including highly sensitive operational matters. Wide-ranging congressional inquiries are accepted by the US intelligence community as necessary and appropriate. Oversight is not something to be feared; it's something that can assist.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the United Kingdom, the Intelligence and Security Committee of Parliament is empowered by the Justice and Security Act 2013 to oversee the expenditure, administration, policy and operations of the Security Service, the Secret Intelligence Service and the Government Communications Headquarters. The British Intelligence and Security Committee of Parliament can consider operational matters when requested by the Prime Minister where they do not involve ongoing operations and it is in the national interest.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Canada is another one of our Five Eyes intelligence partners, and has an intelligence and national security community in size and structure not dissimilar to what we have.

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The approach taken by the new Canadian National Security and Intelligence Committee of Parliamentarians provides a good model for Australia to follow. Centre Alliance has already proposed legislation to implement the Canadian model for parliamentary scrutiny of the intelligence communities through the Intelligence Services Amendment (Enhanced Parliamentary Oversight of Intelligence Agencies) Bill 2018.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Last year, the Labor opposition observed that Centre Alliance's bill: 'Contains a number of interesting and innovative measures. Labor believes these measures merit further consideration.' Centre Alliance has now circulated an amendment to the Counter-Terrorism (Temporary Exclusion Orders) Bill 2019 that again seeks to expand the role of the PJCIS in a way most closely modelled on that of the Canadian parliament. The amendment will amend the Intelligence Services Act to remove most, although not all, the current legislative constraints on the scope of the PJCIS's inquiries, and would allow the committee to review the operational performance of our intelligence agencies—a vital aspect of any effective scrutiny regime. The proposed amendment to the role of the PJCIS does retain existing prohibitions on:</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It also retains the prohibition on conducting inquiries into individual complaints about the activities of designated intelligence and national security agencies, as those complaints are appropriately dealt with by the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are details of intelligence operations involving sensitive and vulnerable sources that are best held by the smallest number of people with an absolute need to know. Accordingly, the amendment provides that the relevant minister may certify that a review of the PJCIS that relates to an ongoing operation, and where the review would interfere with the proper performance of the relevant body of its function or otherwise prejudice Australia's national security or the conduct of Australia's foreign relations—if this is the case—then the committee will be required to cease or suspend the review. And:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If the minister revokes the certificate, the committee would be free to proceed with the review or commence a new review into the activity. This is effectively the Canadian method. It allows for the PJCIS to review intelligence operations. Should the minister have a concern about a particular sensitivity, the minister can issue a certificate but then must advise the committee once that particular ongoing operation is no longer taking place.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The need for the expansion of the PJCIS's role to cover intelligence agency operations and other activities has long been recognised in the Senate. Former senator John Faulkner strongly urged this broad reform. The Leader of the Opposition in the Senate has expressed in-principle support for broadening the PJCIS's mandate. There is, indeed, a vital principle involved here: if democratically elected MPs and senators cannot be trusted to deal directly with these questions then something is wrong with the relationship between the intelligence communities and the parliament that they ultimately mean to serve.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Centre Alliance has previously moved provisions contained in this amendment to other national security and intelligence related bills. On those occasions, the coalition and Labor were not prepared to lend their support, even though the opposition has indicated in-principle support for the extension of the PJCIS oversight to include operational matters. The government for its part announced in May last year the appointment of Dennis Richardson, a former director-general of security, to review Australia's intelligence and national security legislation. This is the latest in a long series of government reviews largely conducted by former intelligence and national security bureaucrats who, at least previously, have had little enthusiasm for parliamentary scrutiny of the intelligence community. However, as Senator Wong has rightly observed, the parliament cannot outsource the question of its own responsibilities in overseeing our large and expanding intelligence and national security services. Enhanced parliamentary scrutiny is very definitely in our national interest. Australia's intelligence communities are not infallible.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the future, their performance will be tested in much more demanding security environments, and the Australian parliament will need to subject the performance of our intelligence agencies to much closer scrutiny than has been the case previously. This amendment provides a sensible and secure framework within which to extend parliamentary scrutiny through the established mechanisms of the PJCIS. It is a very necessary counterpoint to the further expansion of ASIO powers proposed in the legislation before the Senate today, and I commend the amendment to the Senate.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:07</span>):  I rise to speak on the amendment circulated by Senator Patrick. The Labor Party will not be supporting this amendment, but I would like to make a couple of comments regarding the intent of the amendment and the measures put forward by Senator Patrick. He makes the point, of course, that the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security is the primary mechanism for parliamentary oversight of the intelligence committee but that the committee is currently constrained by its enabling legislation. As Senator Patrick rightly points out, it cannot review a range of issues, including intelligence gathering and assessment priorities, sources and methods, particular operations and investigations, information provided by a foreign government, individual complaints about the activities of intelligence services, anything that does not affect an Australian person, or assessments or reports made by intelligence agencies. Of course, we also know from the way this bill has passed through the parliament today that it will not be able to receive the Independent National Security Legislation Monitor's reports at the same time they're provided to the minister or to be briefed by the National Security Legislation Monitor on those reports.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Patrick is seeking to adapt the model of the Canadian parliamentary oversight legislation to extend the function of the PJCIS. I won't go through the various ways that his amendment seeks to do that. I do say that the opposition thinks there is some merit in the proposals that Senator Patrick is putting forward. The work and the structure of the intelligence community have changed considerably in recent years, and yet our oversight structures here in Australia have not changed with them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Passing this amendment here today would not be a complete reform approach. There are things that should be considered, such as how expanding the remit of the PJCIS would have effects on its resourcing and also its membership. We think an inquiry would allow these matters to be determined. And thus, whilst I can't say here today that we would support all of the aspects of the amendments, we think there are many that deserve consideration. We would prefer that these matters be dealt with in a private member's bill and that that private member's bill be able to go to a committee.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The chamber would be well aware that this amendment moved by Senator Patrick today has some similarities to the well-known Faulkner bill—I think it has been the Faulkner bill, the Wong bill, and is currently the McAllister bill—I intend to leave it with Senator McAllister—</span>

                    </a>  Yes, I would like that. We could call it the 'McAllister Act', Senator Patrick, if you like, or perhaps the 'McAllister-Patrick Act'. However, I do note that many of those Faulkner reforms have since been picked up in recommendations of the independent review of the Australian intelligence community commissioned by Malcolm Turnbull in 2016. Whilst this amendment moved by Senator Patrick is not the Faulkner bill, it is complementary to it; they approach different aspects of the need to rethink and reform the PJCIS statutory framework.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I just wanted to put that on record: we're not supporting this, because we think this would be more properly dealt with by a private member's bill. We think there are aspects we would support, aspects we might seek to change. We would look forward to working with Senator Patrick and other members of this chamber in order to bring that forward as a bill, and then potentially referral to committee, where these things could be considered.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:13</span>):  I'm glad that Senator Patrick has finally understood the modern Labor Party! But to Senator Keneally: like Senator Patrick, I do thank her for that constructive contribution. It didn't escape my notice that you included membership of the committee in the things that the ALP may be willing to consider. Of course that's the matter that our amendment, which we'll shortly debate, deals with.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But with regard to Senator Patrick's amendment, I'm pretty bored of saying this but I'll say it again: in the last 20 years, there have been more than 200 pieces of legislation in this country that have overridden fundamental rights, freedoms and liberties. We remain the only liberal democracy in the world that does not have a charter of rights or a bill of rights to protect our citizens' rights. This legislation, brought in by the government, supported by the Labor Party, sets up a minister as judge and jury. It undermines the rule of law. It sidelines our judicial system. On that basis, I think it's highly likely to be found to be unconstitutional, so I do predict that this bill will go down in the High Court at some stage. But, for the reasons that we are seeing this ongoing erosion of rights and freedoms and the slow march down the very dark and dangerous road to a police state in this country, we need to make sure oversight provisions are strengthened. Senator Patrick's amendments do that, and on that basis they will be supported by the Greens.</span>
